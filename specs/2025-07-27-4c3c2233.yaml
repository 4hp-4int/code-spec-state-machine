  status: draft

context:
  project: agentic-spec
  domain: Python CLI tool for AI-powered specification generation and task tracking
  dependencies:
  - name: pydantic
    description: Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations
  - name: datetime
    description: Standard library for timestamp handling
  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  - tests/test_models.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Represent task progress status (e.g., not started, in progress, completed, blocked)
  - Track timestamps for task creation, updates, and completion
  - Store completion notes and comments for each task
  - Model approval metadata including approver identity, approval level, timestamp,
    and optional notes
  - Support multiple approval levels (e.g., peer, lead, override)
  - Track override actions with responsible party and rationale
  non_functional:
  - Models must be fully type-annotated and use Pydantic for validation
  - All fields must have clear, human-readable docstrings
  - Error handling for invalid status or approval transitions
  constraints:
  - All models must reside in agentic_spec/models.py
  - No external database dependencies; models are in-memory/data-structure only
  - Must be compatible with Python 3.12+
  - Follow existing codebase conventions for dataclasses and Pydantic models
  - Unit tests required for all new models and validation logic
implementation:
- task: Define TaskStatus enumeration
  details: Create a Python Enum or Pydantic-compatible Literal for valid task progress
    states (e.g., NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, BLOCKED). Ensure string representation
    and validation.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  acceptance: Enum is defined, validated by Pydantic, and used in subsequent models.
    Unit tests cover all valid/invalid values.

- task: Implement TaskProgressModel with timestamps and notes
  details: Create a Pydantic model to represent task progress, including status (using
    TaskStatus), created_at, updated_at, completed_at (all as datetime), and completion_notes
    (optional str). Ensure auto-update of timestamps on status change.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  acceptance: Model supports all required fields, enforces type validation, and updates
    timestamps appropriately. Unit tests verify correct behavior and edge cases.

- task: Define ApprovalMetadata model with multi-level support
  details: 'Create a Pydantic model for approval metadata: approver (str), approval_level
    (enum or str), approved_at (datetime), approval_notes (optional str). Support
    multiple approval levels (e.g., peer, lead, override) and allow for a list of
    approvals per task.'
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  acceptance: Model supports multiple approval levels, enforces type validation, and
    allows multiple approvals per task. Unit tests verify correct structure and validation.

- task: Implement OverrideTracking model
  details: 'Create a Pydantic model to track override actions: overrider (str), override_level
    (str or enum), override_reason (str), override_at (datetime). Integrate with approval
    metadata to flag overrides distinctly.'
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  acceptance: Override model is defined, integrated with approval metadata, and unit
    tests verify override tracking and validation.

- task: Integrate models for composite TaskTracking structure
  details: Compose a higher-level Pydantic model that aggregates TaskProgressModel,
    a list of ApprovalMetadata, and optional OverrideTracking. Ensure all relationships
    are validated and documented.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  acceptance: Composite model is defined, relationships are validated, and docstrings
    clarify usage. Unit tests cover model composition and edge cases.

- task: Write comprehensive unit tests for all models and logic
  details: Implement pytest-based unit tests for all new models, covering valid/invalid
    data, status transitions, approval flows, and override scenarios. Ensure 100%
    branch coverage.
  files:
  - tests/test_models.py
  acceptance: All models are fully tested with edge cases and error handling. Tests
    pass and coverage is reported.

review_notes:
- Pydantic v2 introduced significant API changes; confirm you are using v2 syntax
  (e.g., use pydantic.BaseModel, not pydantic.v1.BaseModel, and update field validation
  patterns accordingly).
- Auto-updating timestamps (e.g., updated_at on status change) is non-trivial with
  Pydantic models; consider using model validators or custom setters, and document
  any limitations (e.g., direct attribute assignment won't trigger updates).
- For enums and approval levels, prefer Python's Enum class over Literal for extensibility
  and better integration with Pydantic validation and doc generation.
- Composing models (e.g., TaskTracking) requires careful handling of nested validation
  and optional fields; ensure you use Pydantic's root_validator or model_validate
  to enforce cross-field constraints, especially for override logic.
