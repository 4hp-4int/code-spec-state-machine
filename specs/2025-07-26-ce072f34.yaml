context:
  project: agentic-spec CLI Enhancement
  domain: Python CLI tool for specification generation
  dependencies:
  - Python 3.11+
  - logging module
  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Implement comprehensive error handling in the CLI tool to manage exceptions gracefully.
  - Integrate Python's 'logging' module to provide informative error messages and
    maintain logs for debugging and monitoring purposes.
  non_functional:
  - Ensure that error messages are clear and provide actionable information to the
    user.
  - Maintain a consistent logging format across the application for ease of analysis.
  constraints:
  - Adhere to the existing project architecture and coding standards.
  - Avoid introducing new dependencies unless absolutely necessary and justified.
implementation:
- task: Configure the logging module for the CLI application.
  details: Set up the logging configuration at the start of the application to log
    messages to both the console and a log file. Use appropriate log levels (DEBUG,
    INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) and a consistent format that includes timestamps,
    log level, and message.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: Logging is initialized at application startup, and logs are correctly
    written to both the console and a log file with the specified format.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: ce072f34:0
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Implement specific exception handling in the CLI commands.
  details: Wrap critical sections of the CLI commands with try-except blocks to catch
    and handle specific exceptions (e.g., FileNotFoundError, ValueError). Log the
    exceptions with appropriate severity levels and provide user-friendly error messages.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: The application handles exceptions gracefully, logs them appropriately,
    and provides clear error messages to the user.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: ce072f34:1
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Create custom exception classes for domain-specific errors.
  details: Define custom exception classes to represent errors specific to the application's
    domain. Use these exceptions to encapsulate error details and improve code readability.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/exceptions.py
  acceptance: Custom exceptions are defined and used appropriately within the application,
    enhancing error handling clarity.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: ce072f34:2
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Implement fallback mechanisms for critical operations.
  details: For operations that are prone to failure (e.g., network requests, file
    operations), implement fallback mechanisms to ensure the application can continue
    functioning or exit gracefully.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: The application provides fallback options or exits gracefully when critical
    operations fail, without crashing.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: ce072f34:3
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Test the error handling and logging implementation.
  details: Develop unit and integration tests to verify that exceptions are handled
    as expected, logs are generated correctly, and the application behaves appropriately
    under error conditions.
  files:
  - tests/test_cli.py
  acceptance: Tests pass successfully, confirming that error handling and logging
    work as intended.
  estimated_effort: medium

review_notes:
- Implement log rotation using Python's built-in `RotatingFileHandler` or `TimedRotatingFileHandler`
  to prevent log files from growing indefinitely and consuming excessive disk space.
  ([apica.io](https://www.apica.io/blog/6-python-logging-best-practices-you-need-to-know/?utm_source=openai))
- Ensure that log messages do not contain sensitive information such as passwords
  or personal user data to maintain security and comply with privacy regulations.
  ([rishandigital.com](https://rishandigital.com/python/logging-best-practices-in-python/?utm_source=openai))
- Consider using structured logging formats like JSON to enhance log readability and
  facilitate easier parsing and analysis with log management tools. ([signoz.io](https://signoz.io/guides/python-logging-best-practices/?utm_source=openai))
- Set appropriate logging levels (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`)
  to control the verbosity of logs and avoid overwhelming the log files with unnecessary
  information. ([rollbar.com](https://rollbar.com/blog/10-best-practices-when-logging-in-python/?utm_source=openai))
