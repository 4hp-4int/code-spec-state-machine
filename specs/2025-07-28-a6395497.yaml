context:
  project: agentic-spec
  domain: Python CLI tool for AI-powered specification generation
  dependencies:
  - name: pydantic
    version: None@latest
  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Enumerate all class definitions in agentic_spec/models.py.
  - For each class, determine if it inherits from dataclass, Pydantic BaseModel, or
    neither.
  - Document the name of each class and its data modeling base.
  - Produce a structured report (e.g., Markdown or JSON) listing all findings.
  - Ensure the report is suitable for review and future refactoring.
  non_functional:
  - The audit process must be repeatable and scriptable.
  - The output report must be clear, unambiguous, and easy to review.
  - No changes should be made to agentic_spec/models.py during the audit.
  - The audit script should handle syntax errors or malformed classes gracefully,
    reporting any issues encountered.
  constraints:
  - Only agentic_spec/models.py is to be audited.
  - No assumptions about class intent or usageâ€”only inheritance/type is to be recorded.
  - The audit must not introduce any new dependencies beyond those already listed.
implementation:
- task: Read and parse agentic_spec/models.py to enumerate all class definitions.
  details: Use Python's ast module to parse the file and extract all class definitions.
    Collect the class name and its base classes for further analysis.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  acceptance: All class names and their base classes are extracted without modifying
    the source file. Handles syntax errors gracefully by reporting them in the output.

  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: atomic

  approvals: null
- task: Determine the data modeling approach for each class.
  details: For each class, analyze its base classes to identify if it inherits from
    dataclass (via @dataclass decorator or dataclasses.dataclass), Pydantic BaseModel,
    or neither. Record the result for each class.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  acceptance: Each class is correctly classified as using dataclass, Pydantic BaseModel,
    or other/none. Edge cases (e.g., multiple inheritance, custom base classes) are
    handled and noted.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: a6395497:1
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: atomic
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Generate a structured audit report of all model classes and their data modeling
    approach.
  details: Produce a report (preferably in Markdown and/or JSON) listing each class,
    its base(s), and the determined modeling approach. Include a summary section and
    any anomalies or errors encountered during parsing.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  - audit_report.md
  - audit_report.json
  acceptance: Report lists all classes, their base(s), and modeling approach. Any
    parsing errors or ambiguous cases are clearly documented. Report is suitable for
    review and future refactoring.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: a6395497:2

  decomposition_hint: atomic
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Integrate the audit script into the development workflow.
  details: Provide instructions for running the audit script (e.g., as a CLI command
    or Makefile target). Ensure the script can be executed independently and outputs
    the report to a predictable location.
  files:
  - audit_models.py
  - README.md
  - Makefile
  acceptance: Developer can run the audit script with a single command. Output is
    generated in the expected location. Instructions are clear and tested.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: a6395497:3
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: atomic
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Test the audit process for correctness and robustness.
  details: Create test cases with sample model files containing various class structures
    (dataclass, BaseModel, neither, syntax errors, multiple inheritance). Verify that
    the audit script correctly identifies and reports all cases.
  files:
  - tests/test_audit_models.py
  - tests/sample_models.py
  acceptance: All test cases pass. Script correctly handles all expected and edge
    cases, including malformed classes and ambiguous inheritance.
