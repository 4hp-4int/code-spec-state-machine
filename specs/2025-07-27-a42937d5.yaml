  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - tests/test_core_logging.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Add basic logging to agentic_spec/core.py using Python's built-in logging module.
  - Log at least INFO and ERROR level messages for key operations and exception handling.
  - Ensure log messages are human-readable and include timestamps.
  non_functional:
  - Logging should not impact performance or introduce significant latency.
  - Logging configuration must be simple and not require external dependencies.
  - Maintain compatibility with existing code and Windows line ending requirements.
  constraints:
  - Use only Python's built-in logging module; do not add new dependencies.
  - Logging must be optional and not interfere with CLI output unless explicitly enabled.
  - Follow existing coding standards for error handling and file operations.
  - Unit tests must cover logging behavior for both normal and error cases.
implementation:
- task: Integrate basic logging setup in core.py
  details: Add a logging configuration at the top of agentic_spec/core.py using Python's
    logging module. Configure the logger to output to stdout with timestamps and INFO
    level by default. Add log statements to key operations and exception handling
    blocks.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Logger outputs INFO and ERROR messages to stdout with timestamps. No
    errors or warnings are introduced by logging setup. Existing functionality is
    unaffected when logging is not enabled.

- task: Add unit tests for logging behavior
  details: Create a new test file tests/test_core_logging.py. Write tests to verify
    that INFO and ERROR messages are logged during normal operations and exception
    handling. Use Python's unittest.mock or caplog fixture from pytest to capture
    log output.
  files:
  - tests/test_core_logging.py
  acceptance: Tests pass and confirm that logging occurs as expected for both successful
    and error scenarios. No side effects on other tests.

  approvals: null
- task: Update documentation and inline comments
  details: Add inline comments in core.py explaining the logging setup and usage.
    Update any relevant user-facing documentation to mention optional logging and
    its configuration.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - README.md
  acceptance: Documentation clearly describes logging behavior and configuration.
    Inline comments are present and accurate.

review_notes:
- Ensure the logging configuration does not override or interfere with any existing
  loggers if the module is imported elsewhere; use getLogger(__name__) and avoid basicConfig
  in library code.
- To keep logging optional and non-intrusive, provide a function or CLI flag to enable
  logging, and default to no logging or minimal output unless explicitly activated.
- When writing tests for logging, prefer pytest's caplog fixture for capturing log
  output, and verify that log messages do not leak into stdout/stderr unless logging
  is enabled.
- Document how users can enable or configure logging, especially in CLI scenarios,
  and clarify that logging will not affect normal CLI output unless requested.
