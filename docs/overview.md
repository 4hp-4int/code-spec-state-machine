# Agentic Specification Generator - Overview

## What is Agentic Spec?

Agentic Specification Generator is an AI-powered tool that transforms natural language descriptions into comprehensive, actionable programming specifications. It bridges the gap between high-level ideas and detailed implementation plans, making it easier for developers to plan, document, and execute software projects.

## Core Concept

The tool operates on a simple but powerful principle: **Natural Language ‚Üí Structured Specifications ‚Üí Implementation Guidance**

```
Input: "Add JWT authentication to my user API"
         ‚Üì
AI Processing: Context analysis, best practices, current patterns
         ‚Üì
Output: Detailed spec with requirements, implementation steps, files to modify, acceptance criteria
```

## Key Capabilities

### üß† AI-Powered Generation
- Uses OpenAI's latest models with web search access
- Incorporates current best practices and up-to-date library recommendations
- Generates specifications that align with modern development patterns
- Graceful fallback to basic generation when AI is unavailable

### üèóÔ∏è Template Inheritance System
- Build specifications from reusable base templates
- Deep merge strategy allows complex inheritance hierarchies
- Pre-built templates for common domains (web APIs, CLIs, data analysis, ML)
- Custom templates for project-specific patterns

### üîÑ Workflow Integration
- **Sub-specification expansion**: Break complex tasks into manageable sub-specs
- **Specification graphs**: Visualize dependencies and relationships
- **Status tracking**: Mark specifications as draft/implemented/published
- **Foundation sync**: Automatically align with current codebase state

### üìù Flexible Input/Output
- **Multiple input methods**: CLI args, piped input, interactive mode, file input
- **Structured output**: YAML format with consistent schema
- **Human-readable**: Specifications are easy to read and understand
- **Version controlled**: All specifications stored as files in your repository

## Why Use Agentic Spec?

### For Solo Developers
- **Reduces planning overhead**: Generate detailed specs quickly
- **Ensures consistency**: Templates enforce consistent approaches
- **Captures decisions**: Document why things are built a certain way
- **Facilitates reviews**: AI-powered feedback on specifications

### For Small Teams
- **Shared understanding**: Specifications provide clear implementation guidance
- **Knowledge transfer**: New team members can understand planned work
- **Quality gates**: Review specifications before coding begins
- **Documentation**: Specifications serve as living documentation

### For Complex Projects
- **Hierarchical planning**: Break large features into manageable sub-specifications
- **Dependency tracking**: Understand relationships between different parts
- **Template reuse**: Establish patterns once, reuse across features
- **Evolution tracking**: See how specifications change over time

## How It Works

### 1. Context Analysis
The AI analyzes:
- **Project structure**: Current files, directories, patterns
- **Dependencies**: Existing libraries and their versions
- **Coding standards**: Patterns from your codebase
- **Domain knowledge**: Best practices for your technology stack

### 2. Template Processing
Templates provide:
- **Domain patterns**: Web API, CLI, data analysis conventions
- **Coding standards**: Consistent approaches across features
- **File organization**: Where different types of code should live
- **Testing patterns**: How to structure and organize tests

### 3. Specification Generation
Generated specs include:
- **Functional requirements**: What the feature should do
- **Non-functional requirements**: Performance, security, usability constraints
- **Implementation steps**: Detailed tasks with effort estimates
- **File guidance**: Which files to create/modify
- **Acceptance criteria**: How to know when each step is complete

### 4. Review and Refinement
- **AI review**: Automated feedback on specifications
- **Expansion**: Break complex steps into detailed sub-specifications
- **Iteration**: Refine specifications based on new understanding
- **Status tracking**: Mark progress as implementation proceeds

## Template System Architecture

### YAML Spec Templates
Define reusable specification patterns:

```yaml
# Inheritance-based templates
domain: "web API development"
dependencies:
  - name: "fastapi"
    version: "0.104.0"
patterns:
  architecture: "REST API with dependency injection"
  testing: "pytest with async support"
files_involved:
  - "main.py"
  - "routes/"
  - "tests/"
```

### Jinja2 Prompt Templates
Customize AI prompts for different scenarios:

```markdown
You are adding a feature to {{project_name}}.
Context: {{domain}}
For this feature:
1. Consider integration with existing code
2. Maintain coding standards
3. Include tests
```

### Template Inheritance
- **Deep merge**: Combine multiple templates intelligently
- **Override patterns**: Child templates can override parent values
- **Composition**: Build complex templates from simple building blocks

## Foundation Specification

Every project has a **foundation specification** that:
- **Auto-syncs** with codebase changes
- **Captures current state**: Dependencies, file structure, patterns
- **Provides context**: All generated specs inherit from foundation
- **Ensures alignment**: New specifications match existing project conventions

## AI Integration

### Provider System
- **Pluggable architecture**: Support for different AI providers
- **OpenAI default**: Uses GPT-4 with web search capabilities
- **Graceful degradation**: Falls back to basic generation without AI
- **Configuration**: Customize models, temperature, and other parameters

### Prompt Engineering
- **Context-aware**: Incorporates full project context
- **Best practices**: Searches for current recommendations
- **Structured output**: Ensures consistent specification format
- **Domain-specific**: Different prompts for different types of work

## Data Models

### Specification Structure
```yaml
metadata:          # ID, inheritance, timestamps, status
context:           # Project info, domain, dependencies, files
requirements:      # Functional, non-functional, constraints
implementation:    # Step-by-step tasks with details
review_notes:      # AI-generated feedback
context_parameters: # Generation context (role, audience, etc.)
```

### Implementation Steps
```yaml
task: "Create user authentication middleware"
details: "FastAPI dependency for JWT validation..."
files: ["auth/middleware.py", "tests/test_auth.py"]
acceptance: "Middleware validates tokens and extracts user data"
estimated_effort: "medium"
step_id: "abc123:0"        # Unique identifier
sub_spec_id: "def456"      # Optional sub-specification
```

## Workflow Patterns

### Basic Generation
```bash
agentic-spec generate "Add password reset functionality"
```

### Template Inheritance
```bash
agentic-spec generate "Add OAuth integration" --inherits web-api security
```

### Sub-specification Expansion
```bash
agentic-spec expand abc123:2  # Expand step 2 into detailed sub-spec
```

### Review and Publishing
```bash
agentic-spec review          # List all specifications
agentic-spec publish abc123  # Mark as implemented
```

## Quality and Testing
