context:
  project: agentic-spec
  domain: Python CLI tool for AI-powered specification generation and task tracking

  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/db.py
  - agentic_spec/exceptions.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Provide async session management for SQLite (default) and PostgreSQL (optional)
  - Implement async CRUD operations for specifications and tasks
  - Integrate robust error handling for all database operations
  - Allow backend selection via configuration
  - Expose a clear API for database access to other modules
  non_functional:
  - Ensure all database operations are non-blocking and async
  - Maintain compatibility with Python 3.12+
  - Provide informative error messages for database failures
  - Minimize external dependencies; use only aiosqlite and asyncpg
  constraints:
  - Do not introduce ORM dependencies (e.g., SQLAlchemy)
  - File-based storage must remain default (SQLite)
  - PostgreSQL support must be optional and not required for local development
  - Follow existing codebase structure and coding standards
  - All new exceptions must be defined in agentic_spec/exceptions.py
implementation:
- task: Design async database interface and backend selection logic
  details: Define an abstract async database interface for session management and
    CRUD operations. Implement backend selection logic to instantiate either SQLite
    or PostgreSQL backend based on configuration.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/db.py
  acceptance: Interface and backend selection logic are defined and tested for both
    SQLite and PostgreSQL; configuration-driven backend selection is functional.

  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: Interface and backend selection logic can be further
    split into interface definition and backend-specific implementations.'
- task: Implement async SQLite backend with session management and CRUD operations
  details: Implement the async database interface for SQLite using aiosqlite. Provide
    async context manager for session handling and CRUD methods for specifications
    and tasks.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/db.py
  acceptance: All CRUD operations for specifications and tasks are implemented and
    tested for SQLite; session management is fully async and non-blocking.

  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: CRUD operations and session management can be further
    split if needed.'
- task: Implement optional async PostgreSQL backend with session management and CRUD
    operations
  details: Implement the async database interface for PostgreSQL using asyncpg. Ensure
    feature parity with SQLite backend. Backend is only used if configured.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/db.py
  acceptance: All CRUD operations for specifications and tasks are implemented and
    tested for PostgreSQL; session management is fully async and non-blocking; backend
    is optional.

  step_id: d4fe1cd2:2
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: CRUD operations and session management can be further

- task: Integrate robust error handling and custom exceptions for database operations
  details: Define custom exceptions for database errors in agentic_spec/exceptions.py.
    Ensure all database operations catch and raise these exceptions with informative
    messages.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/db.py
  - agentic_spec/exceptions.py
  acceptance: All database errors are handled gracefully and raise custom exceptions
    with clear messages; error handling is covered by unit tests.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: d4fe1cd2:3
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: atomic
- task: Write unit tests for async database layer (SQLite and PostgreSQL)
  details: Create comprehensive unit tests for all CRUD operations, session management,
    backend selection, and error handling. Use mocking for PostgreSQL if not available
    locally.
  files:
  - tests/test_db.py
  acceptance: All database layer functionality is covered by passing async unit tests
    for both backends; error handling paths are tested.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: d4fe1cd2:4
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: Tests can be split by backend and feature.'
- task: Document database layer usage and configuration options
  details: Provide clear documentation on how to use the database layer, configure
    backend selection, and handle errors. Include examples for both SQLite and PostgreSQL.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/db.py
  - README.md
  acceptance: Documentation is present, accurate, and includes usage/configuration
    examples for both backends.

review_notes:
- 'Missing Implementation Details: The specification does not define the expected
  schema for ''specifications'' and ''tasks'' tables, nor the exact CRUD method signatures.
  These must be clarified before coding to avoid ambiguity and rework.'
- 'Technical Gotchas: aiosqlite and asyncpg have different transaction and connection
  management semantics. Be explicit about transaction boundaries and ensure consistent
  behavior (e.g., autocommit, rollback on error) across both backends.'
- 'Integration Points: The backend selection logic must be isolated from the rest
  of the codebase to avoid tight coupling. Ensure that the API exposed to other modules
  does not leak backend-specific details (e.g., connection objects or query syntax).'
- 'Current Best Practices: Both aiosqlite and asyncpg are current and well-maintained,
  but be aware that asyncpg does not support some advanced PostgreSQL features out-of-the-box
  (e.g., JSONB operations, migrations). Stick to basic SQL for portability.'
