requirements:
  functional:
  - 'Provide a REST API for user management (CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete users)'
  - Store user data in human-readable YAML files (no external database)
  - Support listing all users, retrieving a single user, creating, updating, and deleting
    users
  - Validate user data using Pydantic models
  - Return informative error messages for invalid requests or operations
  - Implement async endpoints for all API operations
  non_functional:
  - Maintain compatibility with existing file-based storage and YAML format
  - Ensure comprehensive error handling and clear API responses
  - Support Windows and Unix line endings (CRLF/LF)
  - Provide unit tests for all API endpoints
  - Follow existing code quality and linting standards (ruff, pre-commit hooks)
  - Keep implementation configuration-driven (no hard-coded values for file paths,
    etc.)
  constraints:
  - Use only Python 3.12+ features
  - Do not introduce new dependencies unless absolutely necessary; prefer existing
    ones
  - Do not use external databases; all data must be file-based (YAML)
  - Maintain codebase structure and naming conventions
  - Use pathlib.Path for all file operations
  - Use async/await for all I/O and API logic
  - Use Pydantic models for data validation
  - Avoid mutable default arguments
  - Provide proper type hints throughout
  - Maintain lint compliance with ruff and pre-commit configuration
implementation:
- task: Add REST API entrypoint and routing
  details: 'Implement a new module agentic_spec/api.py that exposes REST endpoints
    for user management. Use FastAPI (if justified) or a minimal async HTTP server
    from the standard library if possible. All endpoints must be async and follow
    REST conventions. Endpoints: GET /users, GET /users/{user_id}, POST /users, PUT
    /users/{user_id}, DELETE /users/{user_id}.'
  files:
  - agentic_spec/api.py
  acceptance: API server starts and responds to all endpoints with correct status
    codes and JSON responses. Endpoints are async and lint-compliant.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 9b93c70f:0
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Define and validate user data models
  details: 'Extend agentic_spec/models.py to include a Pydantic User model with fields:
    id (UUID), name (str), email (str), created_at (datetime). Implement validation
    for email format and uniqueness of id.'
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  acceptance: User model validates input data and raises informative errors for invalid
    data. Model is covered by unit tests.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: 9b93c70f:1
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Implement YAML-based user storage
  details: Implement file-based storage for users in YAML format. Store each user
    as a separate YAML file in a configurable directory (e.g., users/). Use pathlib.Path
    for all file operations. Ensure atomic writes and handle file I/O errors gracefully.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/api.py
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  acceptance: User data is persisted and loaded from YAML files. All file operations
    are async and error-handled. Directory is configurable.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 9b93c70f:2
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Integrate comprehensive error handling
  details: Use agentic_spec/exceptions.py to define and handle custom exceptions for
    user not found, validation errors, and file I/O errors. Return informative JSON
    error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/exceptions.py
  - agentic_spec/api.py
  acceptance: All error cases return clear, structured error messages and correct
    status codes. No unhandled exceptions reach the client.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: 9b93c70f:3
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Write unit tests for API endpoints and models
  details: Add tests in tests/test_api.py to cover all API endpoints, including success
    and failure cases. Use pytest and async test patterns. Mock file I/O as needed.
  files:
  - tests/test_api.py
  acceptance: All endpoints and models are covered by tests with >90% coverage. Tests
    pass and are lint-compliant.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 9b93c70f:4
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Document API usage and configuration
  details: Add docstrings to all new functions and classes. Provide a README section
    or docstring in agentic_spec/api.py explaining how to start the API, configure
    storage directory, and example requests.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/api.py
  acceptance: Documentation is clear, accurate, and sufficient for a solo developer
    to use and extend the API.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: 9b93c70f:5
  sub_spec_id: null
review_notes:
- FastAPI is not listed as a dependency but is implied in the spec; clarify if it
  can be added, otherwise use 'aiohttp' or 'http.server' with 'asyncio' for a minimal
  async REST API, but this will require more boilerplate and less built-in validation.
- "Async file I/O with YAML is non-trivial since PyYAML is synchronous; consider using\
  \ 'run_in_executor' for file operations or look for an async YAML library, but none\
  \ are widely adopted\u2014document this workaround clearly."
- Atomic writes for YAML files need explicit handling (e.g., write to temp file then
  rename); pathlib alone does not guarantee atomicity, and cross-platform support
  (Windows/Unix) must be tested.
- Testing async endpoints with file I/O will require careful mocking or use of a temporary
  directory; ensure pytest-asyncio is used for async test support, and mock file system
  access to avoid race conditions in tests.
