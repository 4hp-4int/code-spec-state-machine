requirements:
  functional:
  - Convert specifications from YAML files to database-backed objects while preserving
    all metadata.
  - Design a data model for specifications, tasks, and work history with support for
    querying and reporting.
  - Track task progress, including status, timestamps, completion notes, and approval
    metadata.
  - 'Implement strict mode enforcement: require task approval before proceeding, with
    override mechanisms.'
  - 'Support multiple approval levels: self, peer, AI.'
  - Enable querying and reporting of work history, including time tracking and export
    in markdown, CSV, and JSON.
  - Integrate database-backed tracking with existing CLI and workflows, maintaining
    backwards compatibility.
  - Provide API endpoints and CLI commands for all database operations.
  - Support optional git commit integration for dual tracking.
  non_functional:
  - Maintain file-based YAML workflow as a fallback for progressive enhancement.
  - Ensure performance and responsiveness for database queries.
  - Provide clear, informative feedback on task progress and approval status.
  - Support data backup and recovery.
  - Maintain Windows compatibility and cross-platform support.
  - Comprehensive error handling and informative messages.
  - Maintain code quality and lint compliance.
  constraints:
  - Use Python 3.12+.
  - Prefer SQLite for default portability; allow PostgreSQL for advanced use.
  - Do not introduce conflicting dependencies.
  - Follow existing codebase structure and coding standards.
  - All new data models must use Pydantic and/or dataclasses.
  - Implement async/await for all database and AI operations.
  - Write unit tests for all new functionality.
  - No external database servers required for default setup.
  - CLI interface must remain simple and scriptable.
  - All data must remain human-readable and exportable.
implementation:
- task: Design database schema and data models for specifications, tasks, and work
    history
  details: Define tables/models for specifications, tasks, approvals, and work logs.
    Use Pydantic models and dataclasses. Ensure all metadata from YAML is preserved.
    Plan for extensibility (e.g., approval levels, timestamps, notes).
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  - agentic_spec/db.py
  - agentic_spec/migrations/
  acceptance: Schema supports all required fields; models pass unit tests; migration
    scripts initialize schema in SQLite.

    comments: Implementation complete with all requirements met
- task: Implement database access layer with async support and error handling
  details: Create async database session management, CRUD operations for specifications
    and tasks, and robust error handling. Use SQLite as default backend, with optional
    PostgreSQL support.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/db.py
  - agentic_spec/exceptions.py
  acceptance: All database operations are async, type-safe, and handle errors gracefully;
    passes integration tests.

- task: Migrate existing YAML specifications to database objects with backwards compatibility
  details: Implement migration utilities to import/export specs between YAML and database.
    Ensure CLI can operate in both modes. Provide clear migration instructions.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/db.py
  acceptance: Specs can be migrated without data loss; CLI supports both YAML and
    DB modes; migration is reversible.

- task: Implement task progress tracking and approval workflow with strict mode enforcement
  details: 'Track task status, timestamps, completion notes, and approval metadata.
    Enforce strict mode: prevent next task until approval. Support override and multiple
    approval levels.'
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  - agentic_spec/db.py
  acceptance: Task progress and approvals are tracked and enforced; strict mode prevents
    unauthorized progression; override works as specified.

review_notes:
- 'Missing Implementation Details: The spec does not specify which async ORM or database
  library to use (e.g., SQLModel, Tortoise ORM, or async SQLAlchemy). This is critical
  for implementing async DB access and type-safe models with Pydantic/dataclasses.'
- "Technical Gotchas: Async database support in SQLite is limited; ensure the chosen\
  \ library supports async operations natively with SQLite, or document any sync fallbacks.\
  \ Also, reversible migrations in SQLite can be tricky\u2014plan for edge cases."
- "Integration Points: Backwards compatibility with YAML and CLI must be carefully\
  \ managed\u2014ensure clear separation between file and DB modes, and test migration\
  \ paths thoroughly to avoid data loss or user confusion."
- 'Current Best Practices: The listed dependencies are current, but verify that the
  async DB library you choose is actively maintained and compatible with Python 3.12+.
  Avoid legacy libraries like peewee or sync-only SQLAlchemy.'
