context:
  project: agentic-spec-foundation
  domain: Python CLI tool for AI-powered specification generation

    version: 0.12.0
    description: 'Core dependency: CLI framework'
  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_core.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_workflow.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_template.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_db.py

requirements:
  functional:
  - 'Refactor existing Typer CLI commands into logical modules: core, workflow, template,
    and database commands.'
  - Maintain backward compatibility so that all existing CLI commands and options
    remain available under the main CLI entrypoint.
  - Update all imports and internal references to reflect the new modular structure.
  - Ensure CLI help output and documentation accurately reflect the new command grouping.
  - Add or update unit tests to cover the refactored CLI command structure.
  non_functional:
  - Improve maintainability and readability of CLI code by reducing complexity in
    cli.py.
  - Ensure all changes are lint-compliant and pass pre-commit hooks.
  - Update inline comments and user-facing documentation to describe the new CLI structure.
  constraints:
  - Do not introduce new dependencies beyond those already present.
  - Retain Python 3.12+ compatibility.
  - Maintain file-based, human-readable YAML storage.
  - Ensure Windows compatibility (CRLF/LF handling).
  - 'Follow established coding standards: async/await where appropriate, type hints,
    error handling, and dataclasses/Pydantic for data structures.'
implementation:
- task: Analyze and categorize all existing CLI commands in cli.py.
  details: 'Review cli.py and identify logical groupings for commands: core (spec
    generation, validation), workflow (spec-complete, sync-foundation), template (template
    management), and database (if any commands interact with persistent storage, even
    if file-based). Document the mapping of commands to new modules.'
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: A documented mapping of all CLI commands to their new logical modules
    is produced and reviewed.

- task: Create new CLI module files for each command group.
  details: Create agentic_spec/cli_core.py, agentic_spec/cli_workflow.py, agentic_spec/cli_template.py,
    and agentic_spec/cli_db.py. Each file should define a Typer app or command group
    for its respective commands, following established patterns and using type hints
    and async/await where appropriate.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli_core.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_workflow.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_template.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_db.py
  acceptance: Each new CLI module contains the relevant commands, with lint-compliant
    code and proper error handling.

- task: Refactor cli.py to serve as the main CLI entrypoint and aggregate sub-apps.
  details: Update cli.py to import command groups from the new modules and register
    them with the main Typer app. Ensure all commands are accessible as before, preserving
    CLI interface and help output.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: The main CLI entrypoint works as before, with all commands available
    and grouped logically in help output.

- task: Update imports and internal references throughout the codebase.
  details: Update any code that imports CLI commands or utilities from cli.py to use
    the new module structure. Ensure no broken imports or circular dependencies.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_core.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_workflow.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_template.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_db.py
  acceptance: All imports are correct, and the CLI runs without import errors.

- task: Update and expand unit tests for CLI commands.
  details: Refactor existing CLI tests to target the new module structure. Add tests
    for command group registration and backward compatibility. Use pytest and Typer's
    testing utilities.
  files:
  - tests/
  acceptance: All CLI commands are covered by tests, and the test suite passes.

- task: Update documentation and inline comments.
  details: Revise README, CLI usage docs, and inline comments to reflect the new modular
    CLI structure. Ensure help output examples are up to date.
  files:
  - README.md
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_core.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_workflow.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_template.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_db.py

review_notes:
- 'Missing Implementation Details: The spec does not clarify how shared utilities
  (e.g., config loading, error formatting) will be accessed across modules. Define
  a clear pattern for shared logic to avoid duplication or import cycles.'
- 'Technical Gotchas: Typer command groups must be registered in the correct order
  to preserve CLI help output and avoid command shadowing. Test the CLI help output
  after refactoring to ensure grouping is as intended.'
- 'Integration Points: If any commands are dynamically registered or rely on runtime
  imports, ensure the new static module structure does not break this. Review for
  any dynamic command registration patterns in the existing code.'
- 'Current Best Practices: Typer 0.12.0 is current as of mid-2024, but confirm that
  async command support is stable in this version. If not, avoid async/await in CLI
  entrypoints or document workarounds.'
