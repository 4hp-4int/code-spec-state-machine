requirements:
  functional:
  - Automatically analyze the codebase to identify database-related components, web
    UI files, and modern architecture patterns (e.g., async APIs, template inheritance,
    configuration-driven design).
  - Enhance dependency detection to capture both direct and transitive dependencies,
    including version information.
  - Improve file categorization logic to distinguish between core logic, configuration,
    templates, tests, and UI/database layers.
  - Generate a more comprehensive foundation template that reflects the enhanced analysis
    and categorization.
  non_functional:
  - Maintain compatibility with Python 3.12+ and existing project dependencies.
  - Ensure all enhancements are covered by unit tests.
  - "Preserve performance for codebase analysis on small to medium projects (\u2264\
    500 files)."
  - Maintain human-readable YAML output for generated templates.
  - Provide clear, actionable error messages for unsupported or ambiguous file types.
  constraints:
  - Do not introduce new dependencies unless absolutely necessary and justified.
  - Do not require external databases or services for analysis.
  - All enhancements must be configuration-driven where possible.
  - Follow established coding standards and pre-commit hook requirements.
  - Ensure Windows compatibility (CRLF/LF handling).
implementation:
- task: Refactor codebase analysis logic to detect database components, web UI files,
    and modern architecture patterns.
  details: Update the analysis routines in core.py and supporting modules to scan
    for common database libraries (e.g., SQLAlchemy, sqlite3), ORM models, migration
    scripts, and web UI files (e.g., HTML, JS, CSS, frontend frameworks). Add pattern
    recognition for async APIs, template inheritance, and configuration-driven design.
    Use file naming conventions and import analysis to improve accuracy.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  acceptance: Analysis correctly identifies and categorizes database, web UI, and
    modern architecture files in a variety of representative codebase structures.
    Unit tests cover detection logic for each category.

- task: Enhance dependency detection to include transitive dependencies and version
    information.
  details: Extend the dependency scanning logic to parse requirements files, setup.py,
    pyproject.toml, and import statements. Capture both direct and transitive dependencies,
    extracting version constraints where available. Integrate results into the foundation
    template output.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  acceptance: Dependency analysis outputs a complete list of direct and transitive
    dependencies with version info for a sample project. Unit tests verify detection
    accuracy.

  approvals: null
- task: Improve file categorization logic for foundation template generation.
  details: Refine file scanning and classification routines to distinguish between
    core logic, configuration, templates, tests, UI, and database layers. Use heuristics
    based on file paths, extensions, and content signatures. Ensure results are reflected
    in the generated YAML template.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/template_loader.py
  - agentic_spec/template_validator.py
  acceptance: File categorization is accurate for a variety of codebase layouts, and
    the generated foundation template clearly separates each category. Unit tests
    validate categorization logic.

  approvals: null
- task: Update CLI and documentation to reflect enhanced analysis and template generation
    features.
  details: Modify CLI help text and usage examples to describe new analysis capabilities.
    Update README and inline documentation to guide users on interpreting enhanced
    foundation templates.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - README.md
  acceptance: CLI help and documentation accurately describe new features. User can
    discover and use enhanced analysis via CLI.

- task: Add and update unit tests for all new detection and categorization logic.
  details: Write comprehensive tests for database, UI, architecture pattern detection,
    dependency analysis, and file categorization. Ensure tests cover edge cases and
    ambiguous scenarios.
  files:
  - tests/
  acceptance: All new logic is covered by passing unit tests. Test coverage reports
    show no significant gaps.

review_notes:
- "The spec assumes accurate detection of async APIs, template inheritance, and configuration-driven\
  \ design, but lacks concrete heuristics or patterns for these\u2014define explicit\
  \ detection rules (e.g., look for 'async def', 'extends' in templates, or config\
  \ file imports) to avoid ambiguity during implementation."
- Transitive dependency detection from import statements is non-trivial and may require
  parsing installed package metadata (e.g., using pip or importlib.metadata); clarify
  if this is in-scope or if only requirements/pyproject files should be parsed for
  transitive dependencies.
- File categorization based on naming and import analysis can be error-prone for unconventional
  codebases; provide a way for users to override or correct misclassifications via
  configuration to avoid false positives/negatives.
- "Unit test coverage for ambiguous or edge-case file structures will be challenging\u2014\
  define a minimal set of representative test fixtures up front to avoid scope creep\
  \ and ensure coverage is practical for a solo developer."
