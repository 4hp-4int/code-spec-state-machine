  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/prompt_engineering.py
  - agentic_spec/config.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Abstract the AI interaction layer to support multiple AI service providers.
  - Ensure seamless integration with existing AI service providers without disrupting
    current functionality.
  - Provide a configuration-driven approach to select and manage different AI providers.
  non_functional:
  - Maintain code readability and modularity to facilitate future enhancements.
  - Ensure comprehensive error handling with informative messages for different AI
    providers.
  - Implement unit tests to validate the functionality of the abstracted AI interaction
    layer.
  constraints:
  - Use Python 3.12+ for modern language features.
  - Maintain CLI interface for automation and scripting.
  - Store all data in human-readable YAML format.
  - Avoid external databases to keep deployment simple.
  - Maintain Windows compatibility (CRLF/LF handling).
  - Keep lint error count minimal (currently <30 from original 134).
  - Use non-blocking pre-commit hooks to show warnings without stopping commits.
implementation:
- task: Design an abstract base class for AI service providers.
  details: Create an abstract base class (ABC) that defines the common interface for
    all AI service providers, including methods for sending prompts and receiving
    responses.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/ai_providers/base.py
  acceptance: The abstract base class is defined with all necessary methods and docstrings,
    and it is ready for subclassing by specific AI provider implementations.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 72ef1b41:0
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Implement concrete classes for existing AI service providers.
  details: Develop concrete classes that inherit from the abstract base class, implementing
    the specific details for interacting with each AI service provider.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/ai_providers/openai_provider.py
  acceptance: Concrete classes for existing AI service providers are implemented,
    tested, and integrated without disrupting current functionality.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 72ef1b41:1
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Refactor existing AI interaction code to use the new abstraction layer.
  details: Modify the existing codebase to utilize the new abstracted AI interaction
    layer, ensuring that all AI interactions go through the appropriate provider class.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/prompt_engineering.py
  acceptance: All AI interactions in the codebase are refactored to use the new abstraction
    layer, and existing functionality remains intact.
  estimated_effort: high
  step_id: 72ef1b41:2
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Update configuration management to support multiple AI providers.
  details: Enhance the configuration system to allow selection and management of different
    AI service providers, including specifying API keys and other necessary parameters.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/config.py
  acceptance: The configuration system supports multiple AI providers, and users can
    select and configure their preferred provider through configuration files.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 72ef1b41:3
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Implement comprehensive error handling for AI provider interactions.
  details: Develop error handling mechanisms that provide informative messages and
    gracefully handle issues specific to each AI provider.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/ai_providers/base.py
  - agentic_spec/ai_providers/openai_provider.py
  acceptance: Error handling is implemented for all AI provider interactions, with
    clear and informative messages for different error scenarios.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 72ef1b41:4
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Write unit tests for the abstract base class and concrete provider classes.
  details: Develop unit tests to validate the functionality of the abstract base class
    and each concrete AI provider class, ensuring they meet the defined interface
    and handle errors appropriately.
  files:
  - tests/test_ai_providers.py
  acceptance: Unit tests cover all methods of the abstract base class and concrete
    provider classes, with high code coverage and successful test runs.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 72ef1b41:5
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Update documentation to reflect the new AI provider abstraction.
  details: Revise the project's documentation to include information about the new
    AI provider abstraction, how to add new providers, and how to configure existing
    ones.
  files:
  - docs/ai_providers.md
  acceptance: Documentation is updated with clear instructions on the AI provider
    abstraction, including examples and configuration details.

review_notes:
- "Missing Implementation Details: The spec does not clarify how provider-specific\
  \ configuration (e.g., API keys, endpoints) will be injected into provider classes\u2014\
  ensure a clear interface for passing config from YAML to each provider."
- "Technical Gotchas: Refactoring all AI interactions to use the new abstraction may\
  \ expose hidden coupling or assumptions in core.py and prompt_engineering.py\u2014\
  plan for a thorough audit and incremental migration to avoid breaking changes."
- "Integration Points: If existing code directly uses OpenAI SDK objects or responses,\
  \ you\u2019ll need adapters or translation layers to maintain compatibility with\
  \ the new abstraction\u2014identify these early."
- 'Current Best Practices: All listed libraries are current as of mid-2024, but verify
  that openai 1.97.1 supports all required features and error handling hooks for your
  abstraction layer; recent OpenAI SDKs have breaking changes in response formats.'
