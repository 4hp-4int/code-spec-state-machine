context:
  project: test-project
  domain: Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool development
  dependencies:
  - Click
  - pytest
  files_involved:
  - cli.py
  - utils.py
  - tests/test_cli.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Implement a CLI tool with a consistent command structure using the Click library.
  - Provide clear and concise help messages for each command and option.
  - Ensure meaningful error messages are displayed for invalid inputs or unexpected
    errors.
  - Support standard flags such as `--help` and `--version`.
  - Implement logging to provide feedback during operations.
  - Include unit tests to verify the functionality of the CLI commands.
  non_functional:
  - Maintain a modular code structure by separating CLI logic and utility functions.
  - Ensure the CLI tool is user-friendly and adheres to best practices in CLI design.
  - Provide clear documentation for installation, usage, and contribution guidelines.
  constraints:
  - Use the Click library for CLI implementation to maintain consistency with existing
    dependencies.
  - Follow the existing codebase structure for file placement and organization.
  - Ensure compatibility with Python 3.7 or higher.
implementation:
- task: Set up the project structure
  details: Create a directory structure with separate modules for CLI commands and
    utility functions. Ensure the main CLI entry point is in `cli.py` and utility
    functions are in `utils.py`.
  files:
  - cli.py
  - utils.py
  acceptance: The project directory contains `cli.py` and `utils.py` with appropriate
    placeholders for CLI commands and utility functions.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: b540485c:0
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Implement the main CLI entry point
  details: Use the Click library to define the main CLI group in `cli.py`. Include
    a `--help` option that displays available commands and their descriptions.
  files:
  - cli.py
  acceptance: Running the CLI with `--help` displays a list of available commands
    and their descriptions.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: b540485c:1
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Add subcommands to the CLI
  details: Define subcommands within the main CLI group in `cli.py`. Each subcommand
    should perform a specific action and include its own help message.
  files:
  - cli.py
  acceptance: Each subcommand can be executed independently, and running each with
    `--help` displays its specific help message.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: b540485c:2
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Implement utility functions
  details: Develop utility functions in `utils.py` to support the CLI commands. Ensure
    these functions are modular and reusable.
  files:
  - utils.py
  acceptance: Utility functions are implemented and can be imported and used by the
    CLI commands without issues.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: b540485c:3
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Add error handling and logging
  details: Implement error handling in `cli.py` to catch and display meaningful error
    messages. Use Python's `logging` module to provide feedback during operations.
  files:
  - cli.py
  acceptance: The CLI displays clear error messages for invalid inputs, and logs operations
    as expected.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: b540485c:4
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Write unit tests for the CLI
  details: Use the `pytest` framework to write unit tests in `tests/test_cli.py` to
    verify the functionality of the CLI commands and utility functions.
  files:
  - tests/test_cli.py
  acceptance: Running `pytest` executes all tests successfully, confirming the CLI
    functions as intended.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: b540485c:5
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Provide documentation
  details: Create a `README.md` file with installation instructions, usage examples,
    and contribution guidelines. Ensure the documentation is clear and concise.
  files:
  - README.md
  acceptance: The `README.md` file is present and contains comprehensive information
    on installation, usage, and contribution.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: b540485c:6

review_notes:
- "No implementation details are provided for how subcommands should be structured\
  \ or registered in Click\u2014clarify if dynamic loading or manual registration\
  \ is expected to avoid confusion."
- Explicitly specify the logging configuration (e.g., log level, output format, and
  destination) in cli.py to prevent silent failures or missing logs, especially since
  logging is a requirement.
- Ensure pytest tests invoke CLI commands using Click's CliRunner for proper isolation
  and coverage; this is a common gotcha for new CLI projects.
- Consider adding a requirements.txt or pyproject.toml to lock Click and pytest versions,
  as both libraries have had breaking changes in recent releases.
