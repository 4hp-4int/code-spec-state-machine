  version: '1.0'
  status: implemented
  parent_spec_id: 3d9915ba
  child_spec_ids: null
context:
  project: agentic-spec
  domain: Python CLI tool for AI-powered specification generation
  dependencies:
  - name: pyyaml
    version: 6.0.2
  - name: pydantic
    version: N/A (builtin)
  - name: openai
    version: 1.97.1
  - name: typer
    version: 0.12.0
  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  - specs/
requirements:
  functional:
  - Read all YAML files from the specs/ directory.
  - Validate each YAML file's contents against the appropriate Pydantic models.
  - Insert or update records in the database using AsyncSpecManager.
  - Support both full migration (all files) and incremental migration (only new or
    changed files).
  - Ensure atomicity and rollback on error during migration.
  non_functional:
  - Comprehensive error handling with informative messages.
  - Maintain lint compliance and follow code quality standards.
  - Support async/await for all I/O and database operations.
  - Ensure migration is idempotent and safe to re-run.
  constraints:
  - Use only existing dependencies; do not introduce new ones.
  - Maintain compatibility with Python 3.12+.
  - Do not use external databases; use file-based storage.
  - Follow established codebase structure and coding standards.
  - All data must remain in human-readable YAML format.
implementation:
- task: Implement YAML file discovery and change detection logic
  details: Develop functions to enumerate all YAML files in the specs/ directory,
    and determine which files are new or have changed since the last migration. Use
    file hashes or timestamps for change detection. Expose both full and incremental
    modes.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: All YAML files in specs/ can be listed; incremental mode reliably detects
    new/changed files; unit tests cover edge cases.

- task: Validate YAML file contents against Pydantic models
  details: For each discovered YAML file, load its contents and validate against the
    appropriate Pydantic model(s) defined in models.py. Collect and report validation
    errors with clear messages.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  acceptance: All valid files pass validation; invalid files produce informative error
    messages; validation logic is unit tested.

  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: covers both YAML parsing and Pydantic validation'
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Implement bulk and incremental migration logic using AsyncSpecManager
  details: Develop async functions to insert or update records in the database via
    AsyncSpecManager for all validated files. Ensure both full and incremental migration
    paths are supported. Track migration status for each file.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: All valid files are inserted/updated as expected in both migration modes;
    migration status is tracked; integration tests verify correct behavior.
  estimated_effort: high

  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: spans async database operations, status tracking,
    and migration mode handling'
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Ensure atomicity and implement rollback on migration error
  details: Wrap migration operations in an atomic transaction-like context. If any
    error occurs during migration, rollback all changes made during that run and report
    the error. Ensure no partial updates are left.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: On migration error, no partial changes persist; error is logged and
    reported; rollback logic is covered by tests.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: a14041e9:3
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: requires error handling, state tracking, and rollback
    logic'
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for migration engine
  details: Develop tests covering file discovery, change detection, validation, migration
    (both modes), error handling, and rollback. Use mocking for async operations and
    file I/O as needed.
  files:
  - tests/
  acceptance: All migration engine features are covered by tests; tests pass and cover
    edge cases; code coverage meets project standards.
