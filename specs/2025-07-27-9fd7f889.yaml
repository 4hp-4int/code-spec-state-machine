  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/cli_core.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_workflow.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_template.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_db.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Each CLI module file must define a Typer app or command group for its respective
    command set.
  - All CLI modules must use Python type hints throughout.
  - Async/await must be used for any operations that interact with async APIs or the
    database.
  - Each CLI module must follow established patterns from the existing codebase.
  - CLI modules must be importable and composable into the main CLI entrypoint.
  non_functional:
  - Code must be clear, maintainable, and follow project coding standards.
  - Comprehensive error handling with informative messages must be implemented.
  - Each CLI module must be covered by unit tests.
  constraints:
  - Do not introduce new dependencies beyond those already present in the codebase.
  - File organization must mirror the current architecture.
  - All code must be compatible with Python 3.12+.
  - Use Typer for CLI command definitions.
implementation:
- task: Scaffold CLI module files for each command group
  details: 'Create empty or minimally structured files: agentic_spec/cli_core.py,
    agentic_spec/cli_workflow.py, agentic_spec/cli_template.py, and agentic_spec/cli_db.py.
    Add module docstrings and import Typer.'
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli_core.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_workflow.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_template.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_db.py
  acceptance: All four files exist with correct names, module docstrings, and Typer
    imported.

- task: Define Typer app or command group in each CLI module
  details: In each CLI module, define a Typer app or command group variable (e.g.,
    app = Typer() or workflow_app = Typer()). Ensure each is ready to register commands
    and can be imported by the main CLI.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli_core.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_workflow.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_template.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_db.py
  acceptance: Each file contains a Typer app or command group variable with correct
    naming and type hints.

  step_id: 9fd7f889:1
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: atomic
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Implement command registration patterns and type hints
  details: For each CLI module, implement at least one example command using established
    patterns from the existing CLI. Use Python type hints for all function signatures.
    If async operations are relevant (e.g., db access), use async def and await.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli_core.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_workflow.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_template.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_db.py
  acceptance: Each CLI module contains at least one example command with correct type
    hints and async/await usage where appropriate.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 9fd7f889:2
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: spans both CLI structure and async/await integration'
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Integrate CLI modules with main CLI entrypoint
  details: Update the main CLI (likely agentic_spec/cli.py) to import and register
    the new command groups/apps from each CLI module, ensuring modular composition
    and no import cycles.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_core.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_workflow.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_template.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_db.py
  acceptance: Main CLI entrypoint composes all new CLI modules, and commands are accessible
    via the CLI.

  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: requires coordination between new modules and main
    CLI'
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Implement error handling and informative messages in CLI modules
  details: Add comprehensive error handling to each CLI module's commands, following
    project standards. Ensure all error messages are informative and user-friendly.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli_core.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_workflow.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_template.py
  - agentic_spec/cli_db.py
  acceptance: All CLI modules handle errors gracefully and provide clear, actionable
    messages.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 9fd7f889:4
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: spans all CLI modules and requires consistent error
    handling patterns'
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Write unit tests for each CLI module
  details: Create or update test files to cover at least the example commands in each
    CLI module, including both normal and error cases. Use pytest and typer's testing
    utilities.
  files:
  - tests/test_cli_core.py
  - tests/test_cli_workflow.py
  - tests/test_cli_template.py
  - tests/test_cli_db.py
  acceptance: Unit tests exist for each CLI module and pass for both success and error
    scenarios.

review_notes:
- 'Missing Implementation Details: The spec does not clarify how async/await should
  be handled in Typer commands, especially regarding event loop management in CLI
  context. Solo dev should ensure async commands are properly run (e.g., using asyncio.run)
  and tested for CLI compatibility.'
- 'Technical Gotchas: Import cycles are a risk when composing multiple Typer apps/groups
  into the main CLI. Explicitly structure imports to avoid circular dependencies,
  and test CLI startup early.'
- 'Integration Points: The spec assumes existing CLI patterns but does not specify
  if there is a shared context or dependency injection mechanism for things like DB
  connections. If such context is needed, define a clear pattern for passing shared
  resources between modules.'
- 'Current Best Practices: Typer >=0.12.0 is current and well-maintained, but confirm
  that all CLI modules use Typer''s recommended command registration and error handling
  patterns (e.g., typer.Exit, typer.BadParameter) for consistency and maintainability.'
