  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - tests/test_core.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Detect scope gaps in real-time during workflow execution.
  - Enable the AI to propose new tasks when a gap is detected.
  - Validate each proposed task before injection into the workflow.
  - Log all rejected (invalid) proposals for audit purposes.
  - Inject only validated tasks into the active workflow.
  non_functional:
  - "Task proposal and validation must not introduce significant latency (\u2264200ms\
    \ per proposal)."
  - Logging must be robust and not block workflow execution.
  - System must be testable with deterministic outcomes for proposal/validation logic.
  - Code must be modular to allow future extension of proposal and validation logic.
  constraints:
  - All changes must be limited to agentic_spec/core.py and associated test files.
  - No new external dependencies unless strictly necessary.
  - Maintain compatibility with existing CLI and workflow execution logic.
implementation:
- task: Refactor core workflow loop to support dynamic task injection points
  details: Update the main workflow execution loop in agentic_spec/core.py to include
    hooks or checkpoints where scope gap detection and task proposal can be triggered
    in real-time. Ensure these hooks do not disrupt existing workflow logic.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Workflow loop includes clear, testable injection points for AI-driven
    proposals without breaking existing functionality.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 04361c3d:0
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: requires coordination between workflow control flow
    and new AI-driven proposal logic'
- task: Implement scope gap detection logic
  details: Develop a function or class in agentic_spec/core.py that analyzes the current
    workflow state and identifies potential scope gaps. This should be modular to
    allow future improvements to detection heuristics.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Function/class reliably identifies scope gaps in test scenarios and
    triggers proposal mechanism when appropriate.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 04361c3d:1
  decomposition_hint: atomic
- task: Integrate AI-driven task proposal mechanism
  details: Implement logic to call the AI model (via openai dependency) with relevant
    context when a gap is detected, and parse the AI's response into structured task
    proposals. Ensure proposals are well-formed and include necessary metadata.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: AI is called with correct context, and proposals are parsed and structured
    as per system requirements.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 04361c3d:2
  decomposition_hint: atomic
- task: Implement task proposal validation logic
  details: Develop a validation function that checks each proposed task for correctness,
    feasibility, and duplication before injection. Validation criteria should be configurable
    and testable.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Invalid proposals are reliably detected and not injected; valid proposals
    pass all checks and are injected.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 04361c3d:3
  decomposition_hint: atomic
- task: Implement logging for rejected proposals
  details: Add robust logging for all rejected (invalid) proposals, including reason
    for rejection and relevant metadata, to a dedicated audit log (file or in-memory
    structure). Logging must not block workflow execution.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: All rejected proposals are logged with reasons; logging is non-blocking
    and verifiable in tests.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: 04361c3d:4
  decomposition_hint: atomic
- task: Inject validated tasks into active workflow
  details: Extend the workflow management logic to accept and schedule validated tasks
    in real-time, ensuring correct ordering and state consistency.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Validated tasks are injected and executed as part of the workflow without
    disrupting existing tasks.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 04361c3d:5
  decomposition_hint: atomic
- task: Write comprehensive tests for gap detection, proposal, validation, injection,
    and logging
  details: Develop unit and integration tests in tests/test_core.py to cover all new
    logic, including edge cases (e.g., malformed proposals, simultaneous gaps, logging
    failures). Use mocks/stubs for AI calls.
  files:
  - tests/test_core.py
  acceptance: "Tests cover \u226590% of new logic, including all error and edge cases;\
    \ tests pass reliably."
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 04361c3d:6
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: covers multiple subsystems (detection, AI, validation,
    logging, workflow integration)'
