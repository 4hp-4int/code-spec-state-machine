‚óè Perfect! Here's the complete workflow overview for the CLI refactoring:

  üîÑ Complete CLI Refactoring Workflow Status

  Main Specification: fce26578

  Progress: 0% (6 tasks pending)
  - Systematic CLI modularization with backward compatibility
  - Strict mode enabled for sequential execution
  - Next: Start with analysis task fce26578:0

  Sub-Specification 1: c5665002 (Analysis Phase)

  Progress: 0% (3 tasks pending)
  - Focus: Analyze and categorize existing CLI commands
  - Tasks:
    a. Extract all CLI commands from cli.py
    b. Categorize into core/workflow/template/database groups
    c. Document mapping and propose module structure
  - Next: Start with c5665002:0

  Sub-Specification 2: 9fd7f889 (Creation Phase)

  Progress: 0% (6 tasks pending)
  - Focus: Create new modular CLI structure
  - Tasks:
    a. Scaffold CLI module files
    b. Define Typer apps in each module
    c. Implement command patterns and type hints
    d. Integrate with main CLI entrypoint
    e. Add error handling across modules
    f. Write comprehensive unit tests
  - Next: Start with 9fd7f889:0 (after analysis complete)

  üìã Recommended Execution Strategy

  Phase 1: Analysis (Start Here)

  agentic-spec task-start c5665002:0
  Complete all 3 analysis tasks to understand current CLI structure

  Phase 2: Implementation

  agentic-spec task-start 9fd7f889:0
  Build new modular structure based on analysis

  Phase 3: Integration

  Return to main spec for final integration tasks:
  - fce26578:2 - Refactor main CLI entrypoint
  - fce26578:3 - Update imports/references
  - fce26578:4 - Update tests
  - fce26578:5 - Update documentation

  ‚úÖ Key Benefits of This Approach

  - 15 total granular tasks across 3 specifications
  - Clear dependencies and logical progression
  - Backward compatibility guaranteed throughout
  - Comprehensive testing and documentation updates planned
  - Systematic execution with progress tracking
