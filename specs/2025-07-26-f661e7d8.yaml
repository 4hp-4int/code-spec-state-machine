review_notes:
- Clearly define the scope and objectives of the 'test caching' implementation to
  avoid ambiguity and ensure alignment with project goals.
- Anticipate challenges related to cache invalidation strategies, as improper handling
  can lead to stale data and inconsistent test results. ([moldstud.com](https://moldstud.com/articles/p-mastering-caching-best-practices-for-back-end-development-enhance-performance-scalability?utm_source=openai))
- Ensure the caching solution integrates seamlessly with existing test frameworks
  and CI/CD pipelines to prevent conflicts and maintain workflow efficiency. ([blog.mergify.com](https://blog.mergify.com/ci-pipeline-best-practices/?utm_source=openai))
- Consider starting with a simple caching mechanism, such as lazy caching, to achieve
  quick performance improvements before exploring more complex strategies. ([aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/caching/best-practices/?utm_source=openai))
