context:
  project: agentic-spec
  domain: Python CLI tool for AI-powered specification generation
  dependencies:
  - name: pydantic
    version: None@latest
  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/utils/deep_merge.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - 'Design a recursive deep merge algorithm for Python data structures: dicts, lists,
    and Pydantic models.'
  - 'Support configurable merge strategies for lists: concatenate or replace.'
  - Implement key-wise merge for dicts, with configurable handling of missing keys
    and None values.
  - Implement field-wise merge for Pydantic models, preserving required/optional field
    semantics.
  - 'Provide configuration options for handling type mismatches: raise error or skip.'
  - Document all merge rules, configuration options, and edge cases in code comments
    and/or docstrings.
  non_functional:
  - Algorithm must be efficient for deeply nested structures (target O(n) where n
    is total elements).
  - Code must be readable, maintainable, and well-documented.
  - Implementation must be compatible with Python 3.8+ and latest Pydantic.
  - All public functions must have type annotations and docstrings.
  - Edge cases must be explicitly handled and tested.
  constraints:
  - No external dependencies beyond Pydantic and Python stdlib.
  - All logic must reside in agentic_spec/utils/deep_merge.py.
  - No changes to other files unless strictly required for integration.
implementation:
- task: Define configuration schema for merge options
  details: Create a Pydantic model or TypedDict to specify merge options, including
    list strategy (concatenate/replace), type mismatch handling (raise/skip), and
    None handling policy. Document all options with clear descriptions.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/utils/deep_merge.py
  acceptance: Configuration schema is defined, type-checked, and documented. All options
    are covered in docstrings.

- task: Implement recursive deep merge function for dicts
  details: Write a function that merges two dicts recursively, performing key-wise
    merge. If both values are dicts, recurse. If both are lists or Pydantic models,
    delegate to appropriate merge logic. Handle None values and missing keys per configuration.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/utils/deep_merge.py
  acceptance: Function passes unit tests for nested dicts, including edge cases (None,
    missing keys, conflicting types).

- task: Implement configurable merge logic for lists
  details: 'Write a function to merge lists according to configuration: concatenate
    (default) or replace. If list elements are Pydantic models or dicts, perform element-wise
    merge if possible. Handle lists of different lengths and type mismatches.'
  files:
  - agentic_spec/utils/deep_merge.py
  acceptance: Function passes unit tests for both strategies and edge cases (empty
    lists, lists of models, type mismatches).

- task: Implement field-wise merge for Pydantic models
  details: 'Write a function to merge two Pydantic models of the same type, merging
    fields recursively. Preserve required/optional semantics: required fields must
    not be lost, optional fields merged per config. Handle extra fields and type mismatches.'
  files:
  - agentic_spec/utils/deep_merge.py
  acceptance: Function passes unit tests for models with required/optional fields,
    nested models, and edge cases (missing/extra fields, None values).

- task: Implement type mismatch handling logic
  details: 'Integrate type checking into merge functions. If types differ, apply configured
    policy: raise error or skip (leave original value unchanged). Document behavior
    and ensure consistent handling across dicts, lists, and models.'
  files:
  - agentic_spec/utils/deep_merge.py
  acceptance: Type mismatches are handled per configuration and covered by unit tests.
    All cases are documented.

- task: Document algorithm, configuration, and edge cases in code
  details: Add comprehensive docstrings and inline comments to all public functions,
    describing merge rules, configuration options, and all known edge cases (e.g.,
    merging None, conflicting types, lists of models).
  files:
  - agentic_spec/utils/deep_merge.py
  acceptance: All functions have clear docstrings and comments. Edge cases and configuration
    options are explicitly documented.

- task: Design and implement unit tests for deep merge logic
  details: Create a suite of unit tests covering all supported data types (dict, list,
    Pydantic model), configuration options, and edge cases. Ensure tests cover deeply
    nested structures, type mismatches, None handling, and lists of models.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/utils/deep_merge.py
  acceptance: All merge logic is covered by tests with >90% code coverage. All edge
    cases are tested.

- task: Integrate deep merge logic with parent system (agentic-spec)
  details: Ensure the deep merge utility is importable and usable by other modules
    in the project. Add usage example in docstring or as a test case. Verify compatibility
    with existing configuration/specification models.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/utils/deep_merge.py
  acceptance: Deep merge logic is integrated and usable by parent system. Example
    usage is provided and verified.
