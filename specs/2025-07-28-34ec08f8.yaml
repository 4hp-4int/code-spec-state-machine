  - name: fastapi
    purpose: API framework for dashboard endpoints
  - name: pytest
    purpose: Testing framework
  - name: pytest-asyncio
    purpose: Async test support
  - name: httpx
    purpose: Async HTTP client for endpoint testing
  - name: websockets
    purpose: WebSocket protocol support/testing
  - name: jinja2
    purpose: Template rendering
  - name: starlette
    purpose: Static file serving, WebSocket, and background tasks
  files_involved:
  - dashboard/api.py
  - dashboard/main.py
  - dashboard/templates/
  - dashboard/static/
  - tests/test_api.py
  - tests/test_websockets.py
  - tests/test_templates.py
  - tests/test_static.py
  - tests/conftest.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Systematically test all API endpoints for correct responses, error handling, and
    edge cases
  - Test data loading logic for correctness, error propagation, and resilience to
    malformed data
  - Test WebSocket connections for connect/disconnect, message exchange, and error
    scenarios
  - Test template rendering for all dashboard views, including context injection and
    error fallback
  - Test static file serving for correct MIME types, cache headers, and 404 handling
  - Identify and document all bugs found during testing
  - Implement minimal, targeted bug fixes for each identified issue
  - Add regression tests for each fixed bug
  non_functional:
  - Ensure all tests are automated and runnable via `make test` or equivalent
  - Maintain clear, actionable error messages for all failure cases
  - Ensure all fixes are atomic and easily revertible
  - Document all known issues and workarounds in developer docs
  - Maintain cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
  - Ensure test suite runs in CI and passes with zero failures
  constraints:
  - Do not introduce new features outside the scope of testing and bug fixing
  - Do not change existing API contracts unless required to fix a bug
  - Follow established coding standards and linting rules
  - Use async/await for all async code and tests
  - Do not introduce new dependencies unless strictly required for testing
  - All bug fixes must include a corresponding regression test
implementation:
- task: Establish comprehensive test coverage for all dashboard components
  details: Create or update test files for API endpoints, data loading, WebSocket
    connections, template rendering, and static file serving. Use pytest and pytest-asyncio
    for async tests. Use httpx for API and static file tests, and websockets for WebSocket
    tests. Ensure all endpoints and views are covered, including error and edge cases.
  files:
  - tests/test_api.py
  - tests/test_websockets.py
  - tests/test_templates.py
  - tests/test_static.py
  - tests/conftest.py
  acceptance: Test suite covers all major dashboard components and passes with zero
    failures.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 34ec08f8:0
  decomposition_hint: atomic
  injected: false
- task: Systematically identify and document all bugs found during testing
  details: Log all test failures and unexpected behaviors. For each bug, document
    the root cause, affected code, and steps to reproduce. Prioritize bugs by severity
    and impact on production readiness.
  files:
  - tests/test_api.py
  - tests/test_websockets.py
  - tests/test_templates.py
  - tests/test_static.py
  - BUGS.md
  acceptance: All discovered bugs are documented with reproduction steps and severity
    in BUGS.md.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: 34ec08f8:1
  decomposition_hint: atomic
  injected: false
- task: Implement minimal, targeted bug fixes for each identified issue
  details: For each documented bug, apply the smallest possible code change to resolve
    the root cause. Ensure fixes do not introduce regressions or alter unrelated functionality.
    Update or add regression tests to cover each fix.
  files:
  - dashboard/api.py
  - dashboard/main.py
  - dashboard/templates/
  - dashboard/static/
  - tests/test_api.py
  - tests/test_websockets.py
  - tests/test_templates.py
  - tests/test_static.py
  acceptance: All critical and high-severity bugs are fixed, and regression tests
    pass.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 34ec08f8:2
  decomposition_hint: atomic
  injected: false
- task: Document known issues, workarounds, and troubleshooting steps
  details: Update developer documentation with a summary of known issues, common troubleshooting
    steps, and any temporary workarounds. Ensure documentation is clear and actionable
    for solo developers.
  files:
  - BUGS.md
  - docs/troubleshooting.md
  acceptance: Documentation is up-to-date and provides clear guidance for resolving
    common issues.

  decomposition_hint: atomic
  injected: false
review_notes:
- 'Missing Implementation Details: The spec assumes all dashboard endpoints, templates,
  and static files already exist and are discoverable for testing. If any are dynamically
  generated or not explicitly listed, you’ll need to enumerate them or risk missing
  coverage.'
- 'Technical Gotchas: Testing WebSockets with the ''websockets'' library can be tricky—ensure
  you handle async context management and server startup/teardown cleanly to avoid
  flaky tests. Also, FastAPI/Starlette static file serving may behave differently
  in dev vs. production; test both scenarios if possible.'
- 'Integration Points: If dashboard/main.py includes app factory patterns or conditional
  imports (common in FastAPI projects), make sure your test setup in conftest.py correctly
  initializes the app context for all test types (API, WebSocket, templates, static).'
- 'Current Best Practices: All listed libraries are current and well-maintained as
  of mid-2024, but double-check that your pytest-asyncio and httpx versions are compatible
  with your FastAPI/Starlette versions to avoid subtle async bugs.'
