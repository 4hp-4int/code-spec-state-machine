  version: '1.0'
  status: implemented
  parent_spec_id: 3d9915ba
  child_spec_ids: null
context:
  project: agentic-spec
  domain: Python CLI tool for AI-powered specification generation
  dependencies: []
  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - specs/
requirements:
  functional:
  - Analyze the current YAML specification schema and enumerate all fields and structures.
  - Map each YAML field to corresponding database (model) fields, noting any direct
    matches, transformations, or required new fields.
  - Identify and document all gaps or mismatches between the YAML schema and the database
    models.
  - 'Define migration logic for all relevant data categories: metadata, context, implementation
    details, and workflow status.'
  - Document the complete mapping, including edge cases and handling for unmapped
    or ambiguous fields.
  non_functional:
  - Ensure mapping documentation is clear, human-readable, and version-controlled.
  - Migration logic must be idempotent and safe to run multiple times.
  - Error handling must provide informative messages for all mapping or migration
    failures.
  constraints:
  - Do not introduce new dependencies beyond those already present in the codebase.
  - All documentation and migration logic must reside within the specified files or
    the specs/ directory.
  - Maintain compatibility with existing file-based YAML storage; do not introduce
    external databases.
implementation:
- task: Enumerate YAML specification schema fields and structures
  details: Parse representative YAML specification files in specs/ to list all fields,
    nested structures, and data types. Produce a structured summary (e.g., as a table
    or annotated dict) of the schema as currently used.
  files:
  - specs/
  acceptance: A comprehensive, up-to-date summary of all YAML fields and their types/structures
    is produced and reviewed.

- task: Map YAML fields to database (model) fields
  details: For each field in the YAML schema summary, identify the corresponding field
    in agentic_spec/models.py. Note direct matches, required transformations, or missing
    fields. Produce a mapping table or annotated document.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  - specs/
  acceptance: A mapping document exists showing all YAML fields and their corresponding
    model fields, including notes on any required transformations or missing fields.

  step_id: f48b0377:1
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: atomic
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Identify and document schema gaps and mismatches
  details: Analyze the mapping to find any YAML fields not represented in the models,
    and any model fields not present in YAML. Document all such gaps, ambiguities,
    or mismatches, and propose resolutions (e.g., model changes, migration logic,
    or field deprecation).
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  - specs/
  acceptance: A documented list of all schema gaps/mismatches with proposed resolutions
    is produced and reviewed.

- task: Define migration logic for metadata, context, implementation details, and
    workflow status
  details: Design and document the logic required to migrate each category of data
    from YAML to the models, including handling of edge cases and unmapped fields.
    Specify how to handle missing, extra, or malformed data. Ensure migration is idempotent
    and safe.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  - specs/
  acceptance: Migration logic is fully specified for all data categories, with clear
    handling of edge cases and safety guarantees.

- task: Document mapping and migration plan, including edge cases
  details: Produce a human-readable document (YAML or Markdown) summarizing the mapping,
    migration logic, and all identified edge cases. Include examples and guidance
    for future migrations.
  files:
  - specs/
  acceptance: A clear, version-controlled document exists that describes the mapping,
    migration plan, and edge case handling, suitable for review and future reference.

review_notes:
- "The spec assumes all YAML files in specs/ are representative\u2014if there are\
  \ variations or legacy formats, parsing logic must handle them gracefully. Consider\
  \ implementing schema validation (e.g., with PyYAML and custom checks) to catch\
  \ unexpected structures early."
- No explicit YAML parsing library is mentioned; ensure PyYAML (or ruamel.yaml for
  better round-trip support) is used and up-to-date. Avoid deprecated YAML loaders
  for security and compatibility.
- Mapping and migration logic must be atomic and idempotent, but the spec doesn't
  specify how to track migrated items or partial failures. Plan for a migration state
  marker (e.g., a field or file) to avoid duplicate processing and ensure safe re-runs.
- "Documentation and migration logic are required to be in specific files/directories\u2014\
  avoid scattering logic or docs elsewhere, and consider generating mapping docs programmatically\
  \ to reduce manual drift."
