implementation:
- task: Implement human-readable titles for generated specifications
  details: Modify the specification generation process to include clear, descriptive
    titles derived from user prompts or context.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  acceptance: Generated specifications include titles that accurately reflect their
    content, enhancing readability.

- task: Refactor AI backend to support multiple providers
  details: Abstract the AI interaction layer to allow integration with various AI
    service providers, enhancing flexibility and reducing dependency on a single provider.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/prompt_engineering.py
  - agentic_spec/config.py
  acceptance: The system can seamlessly switch between different AI providers based
    on configuration settings.
  estimated_effort: high
  step_id: 2a65633c:1
  sub_spec_id: 72ef1b41
- task: Add an 'init' command to set up project configurations
  details: Introduce a new CLI command that initializes project configurations, guiding
    users through the setup process interactively.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/config.py
  acceptance: Users can run 'agentic-spec init' to create or update project configurations
    interactively.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 2a65633c:2
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Enable prompt editing functionality within the CLI
  details: Allow users to edit prompts directly within the CLI before generating specifications,
    providing flexibility and control over the input.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/prompt_engineering.py
  acceptance: Users can modify prompts interactively within the CLI, and the system
    uses the edited prompts for specification generation.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 2a65633c:3
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Simplify and enhance maintainability of the codebase
  details: Refactor existing code to reduce complexity, improve readability, and adhere
    to established coding standards and design patterns.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/prompt_engineering.py
  acceptance: The codebase is more modular, with reduced complexity and improved adherence
    to coding standards, as verified by code reviews and linting tools.

review_notes:
- Ensure the OpenAI Python client library is updated to the latest version to benefit
  from recent features and security patches. ([pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/openai/?utm_source=openai))
- Implement robust error handling for AI API calls, including retries and timeouts,
  to manage potential network issues and API rate limits effectively. ([github.com](https://github.com/openai/openai-python?utm_source=openai))
- When refactoring the AI backend to support multiple providers, design a modular
  interface that allows seamless integration of different AI services without significant
  code changes.
- For the 'init' command, utilize Typer's capabilities to create an interactive CLI
  experience that guides users through the configuration setup process efficiently.
