    version: 0.12.0
    description: 'Core dependency: CLI framework'
  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/config.py
  - agentic_spec/web_ui.py
  - agentic_spec/exceptions.py
  - tests/test_cli.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Expose web UI management commands in the CLI for improved portability and project
    status review.
  - Add CLI command to start the web server for the web UI.
  - Add CLI command to open the web UI in the default browser.
  - Add CLI command to check the status of the web server.
  - Add CLI command to configure web UI settings (e.g., port, host, theme).
  - Integrate all new commands into the existing modular CLI architecture.
  non_functional:
  - Maintain compatibility with Windows and Unix-like systems.
  - Ensure all commands provide clear, informative error messages.
  - Support configuration-driven behavior for web UI settings.
  - Maintain comprehensive unit test coverage for all new CLI commands.
  - Ensure all new code passes linting and formatting checks (ruff, pre-commit hooks).
  constraints:
  - Do not introduce new dependencies unless absolutely necessary; prefer standard
    library and existing dependencies.
  - Follow established codebase structure and modular CLI design.
  - Use Python 3.12+ features and type hints.
  - Store all configuration in human-readable YAML format.
  - Do not use external databases.
  - Maintain file-based storage and configuration.
implementation:
- task: Design and implement web UI management commands in the CLI.
  details: Define CLI commands for starting the web server, opening the browser, checking
    server status, and configuring web UI settings. Ensure commands are grouped logically
    under a 'web' or similar CLI namespace. Use Typer's modular CLI features to integrate
    cleanly with the existing CLI structure.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/web_ui.py
  acceptance: 'CLI exposes ''web'' command group with subcommands: ''start'', ''open'',
    ''status'', ''config''. Each command is discoverable via --help and functions
    as described.'
  estimated_effort: 'composite: involves CLI design, command implementation, and integration
    with web UI logic'

- task: Implement web server start/stop/status logic.
  details: Provide async functions to start and stop the web server, and to check
    if it is running. Use existing or minimal new code in agentic_spec/web_ui.py.
    Ensure compatibility with both Windows and Unix-like systems.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/web_ui.py
  acceptance: Web server can be started, stopped, and status checked via CLI commands.
    Errors (e.g., port in use) are handled gracefully.

  step_id: 9db2ea70:1
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: atomic
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Implement logic to open the web UI in the default browser.
  details: Add a CLI command that opens the web UI URL in the user's default browser
    using the standard library (webbrowser module).
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/web_ui.py
  acceptance: '''agentic-spec web open'' launches the web UI in the default browser,
    with clear error messages if the server is not running.'

  step_id: 9db2ea70:2
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: atomic
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Implement configuration management for web UI settings.
  details: Allow users to view and set web UI configuration options (e.g., port, host,
    theme) via CLI. Store settings in YAML using the existing config management approach.
    Ensure changes are validated and persisted.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/config.py
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: Users can view and update web UI settings via CLI. Changes are reflected
    in the YAML config and used by the web server.

  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: atomic
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Add comprehensive error handling and informative messages for all web UI CLI
    commands.
  details: Ensure all CLI commands handle errors gracefully and provide actionable
    feedback. Use custom exceptions where appropriate and follow established exception
    formatting standards.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/web_ui.py
  - agentic_spec/exceptions.py
  acceptance: All CLI commands provide clear, actionable error messages and do not
    crash on user error or system issues.
  estimated_effort: atomic
  step_id: 9db2ea70:4
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: atomic
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Write unit tests for all new CLI commands and web UI management logic.
  details: Add tests covering all new CLI commands, including edge cases and error
    handling. Use Typer's testing utilities and pytest. Mock web server and browser
    interactions as needed.
  files:
  - tests/test_cli.py
  - agentic_spec/web_ui.py
  acceptance: All new CLI commands and web UI logic are covered by unit tests with
    >90% coverage. Tests pass on both Windows and Unix-like systems.
  estimated_effort: 'composite: covers multiple commands and error scenarios'

review_notes:
- "```json\n[\n  \"**Typer Versioning Issue**: Upgrading from Typer 0.9.0 to 0.12.0\
  \ can lead to installation problems due to packaging changes. Ensure you uninstall\
  \ the previous version before installing 0.12.0 to prevent conflicts. ([github.com](https://github.com/fastapi/typer/discussions/784?utm_source=openai))\"\
  ,\n  \"**Modular CLI Design**: To maintain a clean and maintainable codebase, separate\
  \ CLI-related code into distinct modules or files. This approach enhances modularity\
  \ and simplifies future updates. ([coderivers.org](https://coderivers.org/blog/typer-python/?utm_source=openai))\"\
  ,\n  \"**Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling in your CLI commands\
  \ to provide clear, actionable error messages. This practice improves user experience\
  \ and aids in debugging. ([coderivers.org](https://coderivers.org/blog/python-typer/?utm_source=openai))\"\
  ,\n  \"**Documentation**: Utilize docstrings in your functions to automatically\
  \ generate help texts for CLI commands. This ensures users have access to detailed\
  \ command descriptions directly from the CLI. ([typer.tiangolo.com](https://typer.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/?utm_source=openai))\"\
