requirements:
  functional:
  - Provide an optional web UI for viewing specifications and task history.
  - Display a list of all coding projects with filtering by project, status, and date
    range.
  - Show detailed task history for each project, including approval status and timestamps.
  - Enable filtering and searching of tasks by status (e.g., pending, approved, rejected),
    date ranges, and project.
  - Display approval history and task timelines in an intuitive, chronological view.
  - Allow solo developers to easily navigate between projects and their associated
    tasks/specifications.
  non_functional:
  - Web UI must be simple, maintainable, and easy to deploy (single command, no external
    DB).
  - All data must be read from existing YAML files (no new database dependencies).
  - UI should be responsive and usable on both desktop and mobile browsers.
  - Graceful error handling for missing or malformed YAML files.
  - Maintain compatibility with existing CLI and file-based workflows.
  - Comprehensive unit and integration tests for all new web UI endpoints and views.
  constraints:
  - Use only Python 3.12+ and existing dependencies unless a minimal, well-justified
    web framework is required.
  - Do not introduce any external database or persistent storage beyond YAML files.
  - Web UI must be optional and not interfere with CLI workflows.
  - Follow established coding standards (async/await, type hints, dataclasses/Pydantic,
    pathlib.Path, error handling).
  - Maintain Windows compatibility (CRLF/LF handling).
  - Keep lint error count minimal and adhere to pre-commit hooks.
  - Document all new endpoints, configuration options, and usage in README.md.
implementation:
- task: Select and integrate a minimal Python web framework for the UI.
  details: Evaluate and select a lightweight, dependency-minimal web framework (e.g.,
    FastAPI or Flask). Justify choice based on async support, ease of integration,
    and minimal impact on deployment. Add as an optional dependency in setup/config.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/web_ui.py
  - agentic_spec/config.py
  - README.md
  acceptance: Framework is integrated as an optional dependency; web UI can be started
    via CLI or script; no impact on CLI workflows.

- task: Implement YAML-backed data loading and task/project models for the web UI.
  details: Reuse or extend existing Pydantic/dataclass models to load and represent
    specifications, tasks, approval history, and timelines from YAML files. Ensure
    robust error handling for file I/O and schema validation.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  - agentic_spec/web_ui.py
  acceptance: All relevant YAML data is loaded and validated; errors are handled gracefully;
    models are reusable for both CLI and web UI.

- task: Develop web UI endpoints and views for project/task listing, filtering, and
    detail display.
  details: 'Implement endpoints for: project list, task list (with filters), task
    detail (with approval/timeline), and static asset serving. Use Jinja2 templates
    for rendering. Support filtering by status, date range, and project.'
  files:
  - agentic_spec/web_ui.py
  - agentic_spec/web_templates/
  acceptance: Web UI displays all required views; filtering and navigation work as
    specified; UI is responsive and clear.

- task: Implement approval history and timeline visualization in the UI.
  details: For each task, display a chronological timeline of status changes and approvals.
    Use simple visual cues (e.g., icons, color coding) for status. Optionally, use
    matplotlib or a JS library for timeline charts if justified.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/web_ui.py
  - agentic_spec/web_templates/
  acceptance: Approval history and timelines are clearly visible for each task; visualizations
    are accurate and easy to interpret.

- task: Add CLI command to launch the web UI.
  details: Extend CLI (cli.py) to add a 'web' or 'serve' command that launches the
    web UI. Document usage and options in README.md.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - README.md
  acceptance: User can start the web UI with a single CLI command; usage is documented.

- task: Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for web UI functionality.
  details: Add tests for all endpoints, data loading, filtering, and error cases.
    Use pytest and existing test patterns. Mock file I/O as needed.
  files:
  - tests/test_web_ui.py
  acceptance: Tests cover all new code paths; all tests pass; coverage is reported
    via pytest-cov.

    Add inline comments and docstrings per coding standards.
  files:

  - agentic_spec/web_ui.py
  - agentic_spec/web_templates/
  acceptance: Documentation is clear, complete, and up to date; code is well-commented.

review_notes:
- Consider using FastAPI over Flask for the web UI due to its native asynchronous
  support, which enhances performance and scalability, especially for handling concurrent
  requests. ([codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/article/fastapi-vs-flask-key-differences-performance-and-use-cases?utm_source=openai))
- Ensure that the selected web framework integrates seamlessly with existing Pydantic
  models to maintain consistency in data validation and serialization across both
  CLI and web UI components.
- Implement robust error handling for YAML file operations to gracefully manage scenarios
  involving missing or malformed data, thereby enhancing the reliability of the application.
- Leverage Jinja2 templates for rendering HTML in the web UI to maintain consistency
  with existing CLI workflows and minimize the learning curve, as Jinja2 is already
  a dependency in the project.
