review_notes:
- "Specification lacks concrete details on cache storage backend (e.g., Redis, SQLite,\
  \ in-memory), eviction policies, and serialization format\u2014these must be defined\
  \ before implementation can begin."
- Cross-project cache sharing introduces security and consistency challenges; clarify
  authentication, namespace isolation, and cache invalidation strategies to avoid
  data leaks or stale data.
- Modular architecture for embedding providers should specify plugin interface contracts
  and dynamic loading mechanisms; consider using established plugin frameworks or
  dependency injection patterns.
- For bootstrapping tools, outline expected CLI commands or configuration files to
  ensure developer usability and reproducibility across projects.
