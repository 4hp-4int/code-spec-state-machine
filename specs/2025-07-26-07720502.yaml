  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/prompt_engineering.py
  - tests/test_prompt_engineering.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Integrate additional context parameters into AI prompts to improve relevance.
  - Implement a feedback loop where the AI's outputs are evaluated and adjusted based
    on accuracy.
  non_functional:
  - Ensure the system maintains high performance and responsiveness after enhancements.
  - Maintain code readability and adherence to PEP 8 standards.
  constraints:
  - The solution must be compatible with Python 3.10 or later.
  - All new dependencies must be actively maintained and widely adopted.
implementation:
- task: Refactor AI prompt generation to include additional context parameters.
  details: Modify the existing prompt generation logic to incorporate user-defined
    context parameters, such as user role, target audience, and desired tone. This
    will involve updating the `generate_prompt` function in `agentic_spec/cli.py`
    to accept and process these new parameters.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: The `generate_prompt` function accepts additional context parameters
    and integrates them into the AI prompts, resulting in outputs that reflect the
    specified context.

- task: Develop a feedback mechanism to evaluate AI outputs and adjust prompts accordingly.
  details: Implement a feedback loop where AI-generated outputs are evaluated for
    accuracy and relevance. This involves creating a new module, `prompt_engineering.py`,
    which will contain functions to assess outputs and refine prompts based on feedback.
    The feedback mechanism should support both manual user feedback and automated
    evaluation metrics.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/prompt_engineering.py
  acceptance: The system can accept feedback on AI outputs and adjust future prompts
    to improve accuracy and relevance.
  estimated_effort: high
  step_id: 07720502:1
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Integrate the feedback mechanism into the CLI workflow.
  details: Modify the CLI to prompt users for feedback after displaying AI-generated
    outputs. This involves updating `cli.py` to include user prompts for feedback
    and passing this feedback to the `prompt_engineering` module for processing.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: The CLI prompts users for feedback on AI outputs and utilizes this feedback
    to refine future prompts.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 07720502:2
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Implement unit tests for the new prompt engineering functionalities.
  details: Develop comprehensive unit tests for the functions in `prompt_engineering.py`
    to ensure they correctly evaluate AI outputs and adjust prompts. This includes
    testing various scenarios and edge cases to validate the robustness of the feedback
    mechanism.
  files:
  - tests/test_prompt_engineering.py
  acceptance: All unit tests pass, confirming that the prompt engineering functionalities
    work as intended.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 07720502:3
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Update documentation to reflect the new context-aware prompt generation and
    feedback loop features.
  details: Revise the project's documentation to include information on the new context
    parameters available for prompt generation and instructions on how users can provide
    feedback on AI outputs. Ensure that the documentation is clear and provides examples
    where necessary.
  files:
  - docs/prompt_engineering.md
  acceptance: Documentation accurately describes the new features and provides clear
    guidance for users.

review_notes:
- "The feedback loop implementation is high-effort and could easily balloon in scope\u2014\
  start with a minimal viable feedback mechanism (e.g., simple scoring or thumbs up/down)\
  \ before considering automated evaluation metrics or complex prompt adjustments."
- Be explicit about how context parameters are structured and passed (e.g., as a dictionary
  or dataclass) to avoid ambiguity in the CLI and prompt_engineering interfaces.
- Langchain and OpenAI libraries evolve rapidly; verify that the latest versions are
  compatible with each other and Python 3.10, as breaking changes are common.
- "Ensure prompt feedback integration in the CLI is non-blocking and user-friendly\u2014\
  avoid requiring feedback for every output to prevent poor UX."
