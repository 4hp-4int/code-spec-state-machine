requirements:
  functional:
  - Implement a project-agnostic semantic caching system to store and retrieve AI-generated
    responses based on semantic similarity.
  - Develop an 'init' command in the CLI to initialize and configure the semantic
    cache.
  - Ensure the caching system supports configurable parameters such as cache size,
    time-to-live (TTL), and similarity thresholds.
  - Provide mechanisms for cache invalidation and expiration to maintain data freshness.
  - Integrate the semantic caching system seamlessly with existing AI API calls to
    enhance response times and reduce redundant computations.
  non_functional:
  - Maintain compatibility with Python 3.12+.
  - Ensure the caching system is platform-independent and compatible with Windows
    environments.
  - Implement comprehensive error handling with informative messages.
  - Provide unit tests covering all new functionality related to the semantic caching
    system.
  - Adhere to existing coding standards, including the use of dataclasses and Pydantic
    models for data structures, and async/await for AI API calls.
  constraints:
  - Avoid introducing new dependencies that conflict with existing ones.
  - Ensure the semantic caching system does not require external databases, maintaining
    the project's simplicity.
  - Store all cache data in human-readable YAML format.
  - Follow the existing codebase structure and place new files in appropriate directories
    as established by the current architecture.

review_notes:
- '**Missing Implementation Details**: The specification lacks clarity on the embedding
  model to be used for generating vector representations of queries and responses.
  Selecting an appropriate model is crucial for the effectiveness of semantic caching.'
- '**Technical Gotchas**: Implementing semantic caching requires efficient similarity
  search mechanisms. Utilizing libraries like FAISS or integrating with vector databases
  such as Qdrant can address this need. ([techcodex.io](https://techcodex.io/blog/2025/06/semantic-cache-basics/?utm_source=openai))'
- '**Integration Points**: The ''init'' command should be designed to seamlessly integrate
  with existing CLI commands, ensuring consistent user experience and avoiding conflicts
  with current configurations.'
- '**Current Best Practices**: Consider leveraging existing semantic caching libraries
  like SemantiCache to expedite development and adhere to established standards. ([pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/SemantiCache/?utm_source=openai))'
