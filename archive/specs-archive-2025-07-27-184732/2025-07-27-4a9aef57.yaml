  files_involved:
  - tests/test_ui_navigation.py
  - tests/test_ui_metadata.py
  - tests/test_ui_routing.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Verify that all navigation links in the UI are present and route to the correct
    endpoints.
  - Test that UI metadata (such as titles, descriptions, and context information)
    is displayed accurately.
  - Ensure correct routing behavior for all relevant UI endpoints.
  - Check template rendering for expected content and context delivery.
  - Cover both positive and negative test cases for navigation and metadata display.
  non_functional:
  - Tests must be isolated, repeatable, and not depend on external state.
  - Tests should execute quickly to support rapid development cycles.
  - Test failures must provide clear, actionable error messages.
  constraints:
  - Use FastAPI's TestClient for all HTTP and template rendering checks.
  - Follow existing codebase conventions for test structure and naming.
  - Do not introduce new dependencies beyond those already present in the project.
  - All test files must reside within the tests/ directory.
implementation:
- task: Create or update tests for UI navigation links
  details: Write tests to verify that all navigation links are rendered in the UI
    and that clicking each link routes to the correct endpoint. Use FastAPI's TestClient
    to simulate requests and check responses. Include both expected and edge-case
    navigation scenarios.
  files:
  - tests/test_ui_navigation.py
  acceptance: Tests confirm presence and correctness of all navigation links; all
    routes are verified to resolve as intended; failures provide clear diagnostics.

- task: Create or update tests for UI metadata display
  details: Write tests to ensure that UI metadata (titles, descriptions, context information)
    is rendered accurately for each relevant page. Use template rendering checks to
    validate content. Include tests for both standard and edge-case metadata scenarios.
  files:
  - tests/test_ui_metadata.py
  acceptance: Tests confirm accurate display of all required metadata fields; template
    rendering is validated for correctness; failures are descriptive.

- task: Create or update tests for UI routing and context delivery
  details: Write tests to verify that all UI routes deliver the correct context to
    templates and handle routing errors gracefully. Use FastAPI's TestClient to simulate
    requests and check both successful and error responses.
  files:
  - tests/test_ui_routing.py
  acceptance: All UI routes are tested for correct context delivery and error handling;
    tests cover both valid and invalid routing scenarios.
