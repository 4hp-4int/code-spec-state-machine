  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/config.py
  - tests/test_cli.py
  - README.md
requirements:
  functional:
  - Ensure 'agentic-spec init' command works correctly when installed globally via
    pip or pipx.
  - Prevent Typer choice errors on fresh installs and in diverse environments.
  - Detect and handle missing or misconfigured environments gracefully during initialization.
  - Provide clear, actionable error messages for environment/setup issues.
  - Verify that initialization creates all required config and template files in a
    cross-platform manner.
  non_functional:
  - Maintain compatibility with Windows and Unix-like systems (CRLF/LF handling).
  - Ensure robust error handling and user guidance for setup issues.
  - Support solo developer workflows with minimal manual intervention.
  - Maintain lint and code quality standards as per pre-commit configuration.
  - Do not introduce new dependencies unless absolutely necessary.
  constraints:
  - Do not break existing CLI workflows or automation scripts.
  - Do not require external databases or services for initialization.
  - All changes must be covered by unit tests.
  - Follow current codebase structure and coding standards.
  - All user-facing messages must be clear and actionable.
  - No hard-coded paths; use pathlib.Path and config-driven locations.
implementation:
- task: Audit and reproduce 'agentic-spec init' portability issues on global installs
  details: Test the 'init' command after global installation (pip, pipx) on both Windows
    and Unix-like systems. Document any Typer choice errors, missing environment variables,
    or file permission issues encountered.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: A reproducible list of issues with clear steps for each platform; root
    causes identified for Typer choice errors and environment setup failures.
  estimated_effort: medium

  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: atomic
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Refactor CLI initialization logic to avoid Typer choice errors and improve
    environment detection
  details: Update 'agentic_spec/cli.py' to ensure Typer commands do not fail due to
    missing choices or environment assumptions. Implement robust detection of user
    environment (home directory, permissions, config locations) using pathlib and
    config-driven patterns.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/config.py
  acceptance: CLI 'init' command runs without Typer errors on fresh global installs;
    environment is detected and handled gracefully on all supported platforms.
  estimated_effort: high

  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: spans CLI command logic, environment detection,
    and config file handling'
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Improve error handling and user messaging for initialization failures
  details: Add comprehensive try/except blocks around environment and file operations
    in the 'init' command. Ensure all error messages are actionable and platform-appropriate,
    following coding standards for exception formatting.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: All initialization errors provide clear, actionable feedback to the
    user, with no unhandled exceptions.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: d6182a16:2
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: atomic
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Ensure cross-platform creation of config and template files during initialization
  details: Verify and update file creation logic to use pathlib.Path and handle CRLF/LF
    normalization. Ensure all files are created in user-writable locations regardless
    of OS, and that no hard-coded paths are used.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/config.py
  acceptance: All required files are created in the correct locations on both Windows
    and Unix-like systems, with proper line endings and permissions.
  estimated_effort: medium

  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: atomic

- task: Add and update unit tests for CLI initialization under global install scenarios
  details: Expand 'tests/test_cli.py' to cover global install edge cases, including
    missing environment variables, permission errors, and Typer choice handling. Mock
    file system and environment as needed.
  files:
  - tests/test_cli.py
  acceptance: Tests reliably reproduce and validate fixes for all identified portability
    and initialization issues.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: d6182a16:4
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: atomic
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Update documentation to guide users on global installation and troubleshooting
  details: Revise 'README.md' to include clear instructions for global installation
    (pip, pipx), common issues, and troubleshooting steps for environment setup and
    permissions.
  files:
  - README.md
  acceptance: Documentation provides step-by-step guidance for new users and addresses
    common pitfalls with actionable solutions.

review_notes:
- 'Missing Implementation Details: The spec does not clarify how config file locations
  are determined (e.g., XDG_CONFIG_HOME, APPDATA, HOME fallback). Explicit logic for
  cross-platform config discovery should be defined before coding.'
- 'Technical Gotchas: Typer''s handling of choices and prompts can behave differently
  in non-interactive shells or when environment variables are missing. Test with both
  pip and pipx, and ensure all Typer prompts have sensible defaults or fallbacks.'
- 'Integration Points: If existing CLI commands or config logic assume hard-coded
  paths or OS-specific behavior, refactoring to pathlib and config-driven patterns
  may introduce subtle bugs. Audit all path usage in agentic_spec/config.py and cli.py.'
- "Quick Wins: Use Python's built-in os and pathlib modules for all file and directory\
  \ operations, and leverage platform module for OS detection\u2014avoid custom logic\
  \ where possible to minimize edge cases."
