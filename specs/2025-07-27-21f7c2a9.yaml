context:
  project: agentic-spec
  domain: Python CLI tool for AI-powered specification generation
  dependencies: []
  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  - agentic_spec/core.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Extend the data model to include fields for completion status, workflow status,
    and timestamps.
  - Add indexes to optimize queries on status, completion, and date fields.
  - Provide migration scripts or instructions to update the schema without data loss.
  - Ensure all new fields are integrated with existing logic for specification tracking.
  non_functional:
  - Maintain human-readable YAML storage format.
  - Ensure changes are backward compatible with existing data.
  - Provide comprehensive error handling for schema updates.
  constraints:
  - Do not introduce external database dependencies.
  - Follow established coding standards (dataclasses, Pydantic, type hints, pathlib.Path,
    error handling).
  - Maintain Windows compatibility and lint compliance.
  - All changes must be covered by unit tests.
implementation:
- task: Analyze and design tracking fields for completion, workflow status, and timestamps
  details: 'Review current data model(s) in agentic_spec/models.py. Specify new fields:
    completion status (e.g., boolean or enum), workflow status (enum/string), created_at
    and updated_at timestamps (datetime). Document field types and default behaviors.'
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  acceptance: Field names, types, and defaults are clearly documented and reviewed
    for compatibility with existing model usage.

- task: Implement tracking fields in data models
  details: Add the designed fields to the relevant dataclasses or Pydantic models
    in agentic_spec/models.py. Ensure type hints and default values follow project
    standards. Update __init__ and validation logic as needed.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  acceptance: Models include new fields with correct types, defaults, and validation.
    Lint passes with no new errors.

- task: Integrate new fields into core logic for specification tracking
  details: Update agentic_spec/core.py and any related logic to read, write, and update
    the new tracking fields as part of the specification lifecycle. Ensure all relevant
    operations (creation, update, status change) correctly handle the new fields.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Core logic uses new fields appropriately; all workflows involving status
    or timestamps are updated and tested.

  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: atomic
  progress: null

- task: Add indexes for status, completion, and date fields
  details: If using in-memory or file-based storage, implement efficient lookup/indexing
    mechanisms for queries on status, completion, and date. Document the indexing
    approach and ensure it is compatible with YAML storage.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Indexing or lookup optimizations are implemented and documented; common
    queries are measurably faster or more efficient.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 21f7c2a9:3
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: atomic
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Provide migration scripts or instructions for schema update
  details: Write a migration script or clear manual instructions to update existing
    YAML data files to include the new fields with appropriate defaults, ensuring
    no data loss. Include error handling for edge cases (missing/invalid data).
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Migration process is documented, tested, and verified to work on sample
    data without data loss.

- task: Write unit tests for new fields, indexing, and migration
  details: Add or update unit tests to cover new tracking fields, indexing logic,
    and migration process. Ensure tests cover normal and edge cases, and that all
    tests pass.
  files:
  - tests/
  acceptance: Tests cover all new functionality and pass successfully. Code coverage
    is maintained or improved.

review_notes:
- Explicitly specify whether to use Python's built-in dataclasses or Pydantic models
  for the new fields; mixing both can cause subtle bugs, especially with validation
  and serialization to YAML.
- For timestamp fields, clarify whether to use naive or timezone-aware datetimes,
  and ensure consistent serialization/deserialization in YAML (consider using ISO
  8601 format and test round-trip).
- Indexing for in-memory/file-based YAML storage is non-trivial; document whether
  to use in-memory dicts, sorted lists, or another structure, and clarify how indexes
  are rebuilt on process restart or file reload.
- "Migration instructions must handle missing fields gracefully\u2014define default\
  \ values for all new fields and ensure the migration script can process large YAML\
  \ files efficiently without loading everything into memory if possible."
