  files_involved:
  - tests/test_core.py
  - tests/test_cli.py
  - tests/test_template_loader.py
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/template_loader.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Ensure all core system functionality is covered by unit and integration tests.
  - Run all tests without any caching or persistent state between test runs.
  - Mock all AI API calls (e.g., openai) to avoid network dependency and ensure deterministic
    results.
  - Validate that file-based operations (YAML read/write) do not leave residual files
    or state after tests.
  - Test CLI commands using Typer's testing utilities to simulate user input/output.
  - Ensure tests are compatible with both Windows (CRLF) and Unix (LF) line endings.
  non_functional:
  - Tests must be idempotent and produce the same results on repeated runs.
  - 'Tests should execute quickly (target: < 2 minutes for full suite).'
  - Test output should be human-readable and integrate with pytest-cov for coverage
    reporting.
  - Tests must not require any external services or databases.
  constraints:
  - Do not introduce any test-level or system-level caching mechanisms.
  - Do not use pytest-cache or similar plugins.
  - Do not persist any test data outside the tests/ directory.
  - Follow existing codebase structure for test file placement.
  - Use only dependencies already present in the codebase unless strictly necessary.
  - Maintain full compatibility with Python 3.12+.
  - Ensure all new or modified code passes linting and pre-commit hooks.
implementation:
- task: Audit and update all tests to ensure no caching or persistent state is used.
  details: Review all test files in the tests/ directory. Remove or refactor any use
    of pytest cache, temporary files not cleaned up, or global state. Ensure all fixtures
    use function or class scope unless session scope is strictly necessary (and does
    not introduce caching).
  files:
  - tests/test_core.py
  - tests/test_cli.py
  - tests/test_template_loader.py
  acceptance: All tests pass repeatedly with identical results. No .pytest_cache or
    residual files are created. No test relies on previous test state.

  step_id: 0f2cc667:0
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Mock AI API calls and file operations for deterministic, stateless testing.
  details: Use unittest.mock or pytest-mock to patch openai API calls and any file
    I/O that could persist state. Provide sample responses for AI calls. Ensure all
    file writes are to temporary files that are deleted after the test.
  files:
  - tests/test_core.py
  - tests/test_cli.py
  - tests/test_template_loader.py
  acceptance: Tests do not make real network calls or leave files behind. All AI responses
    are mocked and predictable.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 0f2cc667:1
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Add or update CLI tests to ensure no CLI state is cached between runs.
  details: Use Typer's CliRunner for CLI tests. Ensure each CLI invocation is independent
    and does not rely on previous invocations. Clean up any files created during CLI
    tests.
  files:
  - tests/test_cli.py
  acceptance: CLI tests can be run in any order and produce the same results. No files
    or state persist between runs.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: 0f2cc667:2
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Ensure cross-platform line ending compatibility in tests.
  details: Add or update tests to verify correct handling of CRLF and LF line endings
    in file operations. Use pathlib.Path for all file paths. Validate that generated
    files match expected line endings based on .gitattributes.
  files:
  - tests/test_core.py
  - tests/test_template_loader.py
  acceptance: Tests pass on both Windows and Unix environments. No line ending issues
    are reported.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: 0f2cc667:3
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Document test system constraints and best practices in CONTRIBUTING.md.
  details: Add a section to CONTRIBUTING.md explaining the no-caching policy, how
    to mock AI and file operations, and how to ensure stateless tests.
  files:
  - CONTRIBUTING.md
  acceptance: Documentation is clear, concise, and referenced by future contributors.

review_notes:
- "Check for any use of pytest's cache or temporary files that aren't cleaned up\u2014\
  pytest's tmp_path fixture is preferred for temp files, and all files must be deleted\
  \ after test execution."
- Ensure all openai API calls in tests are patched using unittest.mock or pytest-mock,
  and provide static, predictable responses to guarantee deterministic test outcomes.
- "For CLI tests, use Typer's CliRunner exclusively, and verify that each test is\
  \ fully isolated\u2014no files or state should persist between runs; use tmp_path\
  \ for any file operations."
- Explicitly test file operations with both CRLF and LF line endings using pathlib.Path,
  and confirm that no platform-specific assumptions are made in file handling logic.
