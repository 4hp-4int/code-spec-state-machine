  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Implement a caching mechanism for OpenAI API calls using SQLite to reduce costs
    and improve performance.
  - Ensure that identical API requests return cached responses when available.
  - Provide a mechanism to invalidate or refresh cached responses as needed.
  non_functional:
  - Maintain compatibility with Python 3.12+.
  - Ensure the caching mechanism adheres to existing coding standards and design patterns.
  - Implement comprehensive error handling with informative messages.
  - Write unit tests for all new functionality.
  constraints:
  - Use Python's standard libraries (sqlite3 and hashlib) to avoid introducing new
    dependencies.
  - Store all data in human-readable YAML format where applicable.
  - Maintain Windows compatibility, including proper handling of CRLF/LF line endings.
implementation:
- task: Design the caching schema in SQLite.
  details: Create a table named 'api_cache' with columns for the hashed request key,
    response data, and timestamp.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: The SQLite database contains an 'api_cache' table with the specified
    schema.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: 4f77ed39:0
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Implement a function to generate a unique cache key for each API request.
  details: Use hashlib to create an MD5 hash of the API request parameters to serve
    as the cache key.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: The function returns a consistent and unique hash for identical API
    request parameters.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: 4f77ed39:1
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Develop a function to retrieve cached responses from the SQLite database.
  details: Query the 'api_cache' table using the generated cache key to fetch the
    stored response if it exists and is still valid.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: The function returns the cached response for a given cache key if available;
    otherwise, it returns None.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 4f77ed39:2
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Implement a function to store new API responses in the cache.
  details: Insert the cache key, response data, and current timestamp into the 'api_cache'
    table.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: The function successfully stores the API response in the SQLite database
    with the correct cache key and timestamp.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 4f77ed39:3
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Integrate the caching mechanism into the existing OpenAI API call workflow.
  details: Modify the API call function to check for a cached response before making
    a new API request and to store the response in the cache after a successful API
    call.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: The system utilizes cached responses when available and stores new responses
    in the cache, reducing redundant API calls.
  estimated_effort: high
  step_id: 4f77ed39:4
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Implement a cache invalidation strategy.
  details: Provide a mechanism to invalidate or refresh cached responses based on
    a defined time-to-live (TTL) or manual triggers.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: The system can invalidate or refresh cached responses as needed, ensuring
    data remains current.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 4f77ed39:5
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Write unit tests for the caching functions.
  details: Develop tests to verify the correctness of cache key generation, response
    retrieval, response storage, and cache invalidation.
  files:
  - tests/test_core.py
  acceptance: All caching functions have corresponding unit tests that pass successfully.
  estimated_effort: medium

review_notes:
- '**Technical Gotchas**: Python 3.12 introduced changes to the `sqlite3` module,
  including deprecation of default adapters and converters for `datetime` and `timestamp`
  types. Ensure you implement custom adapters and converters as per the updated documentation
  to avoid deprecation warnings. ([docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/sqlite3.html?utm_source=openai))'
- '**Integration Points**: The specification lacks details on how the caching mechanism
  will integrate with the existing OpenAI API call workflow. Clarify how the caching
  functions will be invoked within the current codebase to prevent potential conflicts
  or redundant code paths.'
- '**Scope Creep**: Implementing a cache invalidation strategy with both time-to-live
  (TTL) and manual triggers may be ambitious for a single feature. Consider breaking
  this down into separate tasks to ensure manageable development and testing phases.'
- '**Quick Wins**: Instead of manually handling SQLite operations, consider using
  a lightweight ORM like `peewee` to simplify database interactions and reduce boilerplate
  code, while still maintaining control over the schema and queries.'
