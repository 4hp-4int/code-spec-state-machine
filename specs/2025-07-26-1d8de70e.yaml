requirements:
  functional:
  - Migrate project configuration from setup.py to pyproject.toml.
  - Integrate ruff for linting and formatting.
  - Replace existing test framework with pytest.
  - Implement a pre-commit hook to run agentic-spec review before commits.
  - Introduce template versioning using semantic versioning (semver).
  - Prompt users for template migration when versions are updated.
  - Cache OpenAI API calls using SQLite to reduce costs.
  non_functional:
  - Ensure all configurations are centralized in pyproject.toml.
  - Maintain compatibility with Python 3.12+.
  - Ensure all new functionalities are covered by unit tests.
  - Maintain Windows compatibility, including proper CRLF/LF handling.
  - Ensure the caching mechanism does not degrade performance.
  constraints:
  - Avoid introducing new dependencies unless absolutely necessary.
  - Ensure all changes are backward compatible.
  - Maintain the existing codebase structure and file organization.
  - Follow established coding standards and design patterns.
implementation:
- task: Migrate project configuration to pyproject.toml
  details: Convert existing setup.py configurations to pyproject.toml, including project
    metadata, dependencies, and tool configurations.
  files:
  - pyproject.toml
  acceptance: Project builds and runs successfully using pyproject.toml without setup.py.

- task: Integrate ruff for linting and formatting
  details: Add ruff configuration to pyproject.toml and remove existing linting tools.
    Update pre-commit hooks to use ruff.
  files:
  - pyproject.toml
  - .pre-commit-config.yaml
  acceptance: Codebase passes ruff linting and formatting checks.

- task: Implement pre-commit hook to run agentic-spec review
  details: Add a pre-commit hook that runs agentic-spec review to prevent incomplete
    specifications from being committed.
  files:
  - .pre-commit-config.yaml
  acceptance: Pre-commit hook successfully prevents commits with incomplete specifications.

- task: Introduce template versioning using semver
  details: Implement semantic versioning for templates and prompt users for migration
    when versions are updated.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/template_loader.py
  - agentic_spec/template_validator.py
  acceptance: Templates are versioned using semver, and users are prompted for migration
    when necessary.

- task: Cache OpenAI API calls using SQLite
  details: Implement caching mechanism for OpenAI API calls using SQLite to reduce
    costs and improve performance.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: OpenAI API calls are cached successfully, reducing redundant calls and
    associated costs.

review_notes:
- The caching mechanism for OpenAI API calls using SQLite (agentic_spec/core.py) will
  require careful handling of concurrent access and cache invalidation; SQLite can
  lock under heavy parallel use, so consider using WAL mode and ensure thread/process
  safety.
- "For template versioning and migration prompts (agentic_spec/template_loader.py,\
  \ agentic_spec/template_validator.py), specify how version metadata is stored and\
  \ surfaced to users\u2014missing details here could block implementation; clarify\
  \ the user prompt mechanism (CLI, config, etc.)."
- "Switching to ruff for linting/formatting and pytest for testing is straightforward,\
  \ but ensure all legacy config and hooks are fully removed to avoid conflicts\u2014\
  double-check .pre-commit-config.yaml and pyproject.toml for any leftover references."
- The pre-commit hook for agentic-spec review must fail gracefully and provide actionable
  feedback; ensure it does not block commits on false positives or in environments
  where agentic-spec is not installed (e.g., CI/CD).
