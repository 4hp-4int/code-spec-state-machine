  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/config.py
  - agentic_spec/exceptions.py
  - tests/test_core.py
  - tests/test_cache.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Implement a caching mechanism for AI-generated specification results to avoid
    redundant API calls.
  - Allow cache to be enabled/disabled via configuration (YAML-driven, no hard-coded
    toggles).
  - Ensure cache is file-based, human-readable (YAML), and stored in a predictable
    location.
  - Provide cache invalidation and refresh options for tests and CLI usage.
  - Integrate cache logic into core AI call workflow without breaking async/await
    patterns.
  - Write unit tests to verify cache hits, misses, invalidation, and error handling.
  non_functional:
  - Maintain compatibility with Windows (CRLF/LF handling).
  - Ensure all cache operations use pathlib.Path.
  - Comprehensive error handling with informative messages for cache failures.
  - Keep cache logic isolated and testable.
  - Maintain lint compliance and follow pre-commit hooks.
  constraints:
  - Do not introduce new dependencies unless absolutely necessary; prefer PyYAML and
    stdlib.
  - Do not use external databases or non-human-readable formats.
  - Do not break async/await or introduce blocking I/O in async code.
  - Follow existing codebase structure and configuration-driven patterns.
  - All new code must be covered by unit tests.
implementation:
- task: Design and implement cache interface and logic
  details: Create a cache module or class in agentic_spec/core.py or a new agentic_spec/cache.py
    if separation is warranted. Use YAML for serialization. Expose async-compatible
    cache get/set/invalidate methods. Use pathlib.Path for all file operations. Read
    cache location and enable/disable from config.yaml via agentic_spec/config.py.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/config.py
  acceptance: Cache logic is accessible from core AI call workflow, respects config,
    and is fully async-compatible.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: a8694939:0
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Integrate cache into AI specification generation workflow
  details: Modify the AI call logic in agentic_spec/core.py to check the cache before
    making an API call. On cache hit, return cached result. On miss, call AI, store
    result in cache, and return. Ensure error handling for cache read/write failures.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: AI calls are skipped when cache hit occurs; cache is updated on miss;
    errors are handled gracefully.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: a8694939:1
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Implement cache invalidation and refresh logic
  details: Provide methods to invalidate (delete) cache entries or refresh them (force
    re-fetch from AI and update cache). Expose these via CLI options and for use in
    tests.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: Cache can be invalidated or refreshed via CLI and programmatically;
    behavior is covered by tests.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: a8694939:2
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Write unit tests for caching behavior
  details: Add tests in tests/test_core.py or tests/test_cache.py to cover cache hits,
    misses, invalidation, refresh, and error scenarios. Use pytest and mock AI calls
    to avoid real API usage.
  files:
  - tests/test_core.py
  - tests/test_cache.py
  acceptance: All cache logic is covered by tests; tests pass and do not require network
    access.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: a8694939:3
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Document cache usage and configuration
  details: Update README or add inline docstrings to explain cache configuration,
    usage, and troubleshooting. Ensure documentation covers enabling/disabling cache,
    cache location, and invalidation.
  files:
  - README.md
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Documentation is clear, accurate, and covers all cache-related features.
  estimated_effort: low

review_notes:
- "Missing Implementation Details: The spec does not clarify how cache keys are generated\
  \ or how cache entries are uniquely identified per AI input\u2014define a deterministic,\
  \ collision-resistant keying strategy (e.g., hash of input parameters)."
- 'Technical Gotchas: YAML serialization/deserialization is not async; using PyYAML
  in async code will block the event loop. Use run_in_executor or aiofiles for file
  I/O to maintain async compatibility.'
- 'Integration Points: Ensure config.yaml is loaded once and reused, not re-read on
  every cache operation. If config access is synchronous, wrap it for async use or
  document the sync boundary clearly.'
- 'Current Best Practices: PyYAML 6.0.2 is current, but be aware of safe_load vs.
  load for security. For CLI integration, prefer click or argparse, but do not introduce
  click if not already present.'
