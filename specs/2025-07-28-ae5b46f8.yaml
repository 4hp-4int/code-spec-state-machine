  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - tests/test_core.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Enable injection of new tasks into the active in-memory workflow graph at runtime.
  - Ensure atomicity of graph updates during task injection.
  - Maintain workflow graph consistency after injection.
  - Detect and handle duplicate task IDs.
  - Detect and prevent circular dependencies.
  - Validate parent references for injected tasks.
  - Provide clear error messages for all edge cases.
  non_functional:
  - Updates must not degrade workflow execution performance.
  - Error handling must not crash the system; all exceptions should be handled gracefully.
  - "Code must be covered by automated tests (\u226590% coverage for new logic)."
  constraints:
  - All logic must reside in agentic_spec/core.py.
  - Testing must be implemented in tests/test_core.py.
  - Must use networkx for graph operations.
  - No external state persistence; all updates are in-memory only.
implementation:
- task: Define API for task injection in agentic_spec/core.py
  details: Design and document a function (e.g., inject_task) that accepts parameters
    for the new task (ID, metadata, parent references, etc.) and injects it into the
    active workflow graph. Specify expected input types and return values. Ensure
    the API is clear and extensible.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Function signature and docstring are clear; parameters cover all necessary
    task attributes; API is discoverable and testable.
  estimated_effort: atomic
  step_id: ae5b46f8:0
  decomposition_hint: atomic
- task: Implement atomic in-memory graph update logic for task injection
  details: Use networkx to add the new task node and edges to the workflow graph in
    a single, atomic operation. Ensure that either the entire update succeeds or the
    graph remains unchanged. Use try/except and rollback strategies as needed.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Graph is updated atomically; partial updates are not possible; rollback
    occurs on failure.
  estimated_effort: atomic
  step_id: ae5b46f8:1
  decomposition_hint: atomic
- task: Validate and handle duplicate task IDs
  details: Before injection, check if the task ID already exists in the graph. If
    so, raise a descriptive exception and do not modify the graph.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Duplicate IDs are detected and prevented; error message is clear; graph
    remains unchanged.
  estimated_effort: atomic
  step_id: ae5b46f8:2
  decomposition_hint: atomic
- task: Detect and prevent circular dependencies during injection
  details: After tentative edge addition, use networkx to check for cycles. If a cycle
    is detected, abort the injection and raise a descriptive exception.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Circular dependencies are detected and prevented; error message is clear;
    graph remains unchanged.
  estimated_effort: atomic
  step_id: ae5b46f8:3
  decomposition_hint: atomic
- task: Validate parent references for injected tasks
  details: Ensure all specified parent task IDs exist in the current graph before
    injection. If any parent is invalid, abort and raise a descriptive exception.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Invalid parent references are detected and prevented; error message
    is clear; graph remains unchanged.
  estimated_effort: atomic
  step_id: ae5b46f8:4
  decomposition_hint: atomic
- task: Graceful error handling and rollback for all edge cases
  details: Implement robust error handling for all injection failures (duplicate IDs,
    cycles, invalid parents). Ensure that the workflow graph is never left in an inconsistent
    state. All exceptions should be custom and informative.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: All edge cases are handled gracefully; no partial updates; custom exceptions
    are used.
  estimated_effort: atomic
  step_id: ae5b46f8:5
  decomposition_hint: atomic
- task: Write comprehensive unit tests for task injection logic
  details: 'Create tests in tests/test_core.py covering: successful injection, duplicate
    ID, circular dependency, invalid parent, and atomicity/rollback. Use pytest and
    networkx for assertions.'
  files:
  - tests/test_core.py
  acceptance: "All functional and edge cases are tested; \u226590% coverage for new\
    \ logic; tests pass reliably."
  estimated_effort: atomic
  step_id: ae5b46f8:6
  decomposition_hint: atomic
- task: Document integration points and usage examples
  details: Add docstrings and usage examples for the injection API in agentic_spec/core.py.
    Optionally, update README or internal documentation if required by project standards.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Documentation is clear, accurate, and includes at least one usage example.
