requirements:
  functional:
  - Automatically create a new git feature branch when a workflow task is started,
    using a consistent naming convention.
  - Detect and inject new tasks into the active workflow in real-time when the AI
    identifies scope gaps during execution.
  - Update the workflow graph in real-time to reflect the current state, including
    dynamically injected tasks and their relationships.
  - Integrate git branch management and dynamic task injection seamlessly with the
    existing agentic-spec CLI and workflow system.
  - Provide clear CLI feedback and error messages for all git and workflow operations.
  non_functional:
  - Maintain backward compatibility with existing workflows for users not utilizing
    the git-aware features.
  - Ensure all git operations are atomic and provide informative error handling for
    common git issues (e.g., uncommitted changes, merge conflicts).
  - Minimize performance impact by using efficient git operations and in-memory graph
    updates.
  - Support Windows and Unix-like environments for all git and file operations.
  - Provide unit and integration tests for all new functionality, including edge cases
    for git and dynamic task injection.
  constraints:
  - Use only the existing dependencies or Python standard library (e.g., subprocess
    for git operations); do not introduce new dependencies unless absolutely necessary.
  - All new data and state must remain file-based and human-readable (YAML or plain
    text).
  - 'Follow established coding standards: async/await where appropriate, pathlib.Path
    for file operations, type hints, dataclasses/Pydantic models, and comprehensive
    error handling.'
  - CLI interface must remain scriptable and automation-friendly.
  - Do not require external databases or persistent services.
implementation:
- task: Implement git feature branch management integrated with workflow tasks.
  details: Extend the workflow initiation logic to check for an active git repository.
    When a new workflow task is started, automatically create and checkout a new feature
    branch named using a convention such as 'feature/{task_id}_{task_slug}'. Ensure
    atomicity and handle edge cases (e.g., uncommitted changes, branch already exists).
    Integrate this logic into the CLI and core workflow engine.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/exceptions.py
  acceptance: Starting a workflow task from the CLI creates a new git branch with
    the correct name, switches to it, and provides clear feedback. Errors (e.g., dirty
    working tree) are handled gracefully with informative messages.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: e42b7b72:0
  decomposition_hint: atomic
  injected: false
- task: Add comprehensive logging for git operations
  details: Implement structured logging for all git utility operations to aid in debugging
    and monitoring. Include success/failure states, operation timing, and error details.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/logging_config.py
  acceptance: All git operations are logged with appropriate detail levels
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: e42b7b72:6

  injected: true
  injection_metadata:
    injected_at: '2025-07-28T17:23:25.945015'
    injected_by: ai_system
    reason: scope_gap_detected
    trigger: git_operation_debugging_needed
    source: ai_analysis
- task: Enable real-time dynamic task injection during workflow execution.
  details: Modify the workflow execution engine to allow the AI to inject new tasks
    when scope gaps are detected. Dynamically update the in-memory workflow graph
    and persist changes to the YAML spec files. Ensure injected tasks are tracked
    with unique IDs and proper parent-child relationships. Provide CLI feedback when
    tasks are injected.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: When the AI identifies a missing task, it is injected into the active
    workflow, the graph is updated, and the user is notified via CLI. Injected tasks
    appear in the YAML spec and workflow graph.

  sub_spec_id: 0a5fd786
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: high-effort task requiring breakdown'
  injected: false
- task: Maintain real-time workflow graph updates reflecting current development state.
  details: Extend the graph_visualization module to support real-time updates as tasks
    are added, completed, or injected. Ensure the graph accurately reflects the current
    state, including dynamically injected tasks and their relationships. Provide CLI
    commands to visualize the current workflow graph.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/graph_visualization.py
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: The workflow graph updates in real-time as tasks are added or injected.
    CLI command displays the up-to-date graph, including new and injected tasks.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: e42b7b72:2
  decomposition_hint: atomic
  injected: false
- task: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback for git and workflow operations.
  details: Implement robust error handling for all git operations (e.g., branch creation,
    checkout, merge conflicts) and workflow updates. Provide clear, actionable CLI
    messages for all failure modes. Ensure errors do not leave the repository or workflow
    in an inconsistent state.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/exceptions.py
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: All errors are caught and reported with informative messages. The system
    remains stable and consistent after any failure.

  step_id: e42b7b72:3
  decomposition_hint: atomic
  injected: false
- task: 'Testing: Unit and integration tests for git-aware workflow and dynamic task
    injection.'
  details: Develop unit tests for git branch management, task injection logic, and
    workflow graph updates. Create integration tests simulating real-world usage,
    including edge cases (e.g., injecting tasks mid-execution, git errors). Use pytest
    and mock git operations where necessary.
  files:
  - tests/test_git_workflow.py
  - tests/test_dynamic_task_injection.py
  acceptance: All new tests pass, covering normal and edge cases for git and dynamic
    workflow features. Test coverage is reported via pytest-cov.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: e42b7b72:4
  decomposition_hint: atomic
  injected: false
- task: 'Documentation: Update CLI help, user docs, and inline comments for new features.'
  details: Update CLI help output to describe git-aware workflow and dynamic task
    injection. Add user documentation (README or docs/) explaining new workflows,
    branch naming conventions, and troubleshooting. Add inline comments and docstrings
    for all new logic.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - README.md
  acceptance: Documentation is clear, up-to-date, and covers all new features. CLI
    help reflects new commands and options.

review_notes:
- 'Missing Implementation Details: The spec does not specify how git operations will
  be abstracted (e.g., direct subprocess calls vs. a helper module), nor how atomicity
  will be enforced if multiple git commands are needed in sequence. Define a clear
  git utility layer to encapsulate these operations and ensure rollback on failure.'
- 'Technical Gotchas: Handling git on Windows vs. Unix can introduce subtle bugs (e.g.,
  path handling, shell quoting, git executable location). Explicitly test subprocess
  calls for cross-platform compatibility and document any OS-specific logic.'
- 'Integration Points: Real-time graph and YAML updates must be tightly coupledâ€”ensure
  that task injection updates both in-memory and persisted state atomically, or risk
  workflow desync. Consider a single update function that handles both.'
- 'Current Best Practices: All dependencies are current as of mid-2024, but ensure
  that CLI feedback is both human- and machine-readable (e.g., use Typer''s rich output
  and structured exit codes) to maintain scriptability and automation-friendliness.'
