implementation:
- task: Define coding standards for data structures using dataclasses and Pydantic
    models.
  details: Establish guidelines for creating data structures using Python's dataclasses
    and Pydantic models. Ensure that all data models inherit from Pydantic's BaseModel
    and utilize type annotations for all fields. Use Pydantic's Field for validation
    and metadata, and implement custom validation logic using @field_validator decorators.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  acceptance: All data models in the codebase adhere to the defined standards, with
    appropriate validation and metadata.

  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Establish guidelines for implementing asynchronous operations with async/await.
  details: Define best practices for implementing asynchronous operations using Python's
    async/await syntax. Ensure that all AI API calls and other I/O-bound operations
    are performed asynchronously to improve performance. Utilize asyncio for managing
    asynchronous tasks and ensure proper exception handling within async functions.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: All asynchronous operations in the codebase follow the established guidelines,
    with proper use of async/await and exception handling.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: f96e2544:1
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Specify the use of Python type hints throughout the codebase.
  details: Mandate the use of Python type hints for all function signatures, class
    attributes, and variables to improve code readability and facilitate static analysis.
    Utilize built-in generic types and import necessary types from the typing module.
    Ensure that all type hints are accurate and up-to-date.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/config.py
  acceptance: All code in the codebase includes accurate and up-to-date type hints.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: f96e2544:2
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Standardize file operations using pathlib.Path.
  details: Replace all traditional file path handling and operations with Python's
    pathlib.Path to improve code readability and maintainability. Ensure that all
    file operations, including reading, writing, and path manipulations, utilize pathlib.Path
    methods.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/config.py
  acceptance: All file operations in the codebase use pathlib.Path, with no instances
    of os.path or string-based path manipulations.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: f96e2544:3
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Implement comprehensive error handling with informative messages.
  details: Establish a standardized approach to error handling across the codebase.
    Ensure that all exceptions are caught and handled appropriately, with informative
    error messages that aid in debugging. Utilize custom exception classes where applicable
    and ensure that error messages provide sufficient context.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: All code includes comprehensive error handling with informative messages,
    and no unhandled exceptions are present.
  estimated_effort: high
  step_id: f96e2544:4
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Mandate unit tests for all new functionality.
  details: Require that all new features and functions include corresponding unit
    tests to ensure code reliability and prevent regressions. Utilize pytest as the
    testing framework and ensure that tests cover various edge cases and scenarios.
    Maintain a directory structure for tests that mirrors the source code.
  files:
  - tests/
  acceptance: All new functionality is accompanied by unit tests with sufficient coverage,
    and all tests pass successfully.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: f96e2544:5
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Promote configuration-driven behavior over hard-coded values.
  details: Encourage the use of configuration files and environment variables to manage
    application settings and behavior, rather than hard-coding values. Utilize Pydantic's
    settings management capabilities to define and validate configuration settings,
    and ensure that the application can read from YAML configuration files.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/config.py
  acceptance: All configurable aspects of the application are managed through configuration
    files or environment variables, with no hard-coded values present.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: f96e2544:6
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Ensure CLI backward compatibility when adding features.
  details: Establish guidelines for adding new features to the CLI while maintaining
    backward compatibility. Ensure that new features do not break existing functionality
    and that any changes to the CLI interface are documented. Utilize argparse or
    Typer for CLI argument parsing and ensure that default behaviors remain consistent.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: All new CLI features are added without breaking existing functionality,
    and the CLI remains backward compatible.

review_notes:
- "The spec requires both dataclasses and Pydantic models for data structures, but\
  \ Pydantic v2+ no longer relies on dataclasses internally and using both can cause\
  \ confusion\u2014clarify when to use each, or standardize on Pydantic models for\
  \ consistency."
- "For async AI API calls, ensure the OpenAI library version specified (1.97+) supports\
  \ asyncio natively\u2014double-check usage patterns, as some OpenAI endpoints may\
  \ still require explicit async wrappers or session management."
- "The spec mandates pathlib.Path for all file operations, but PyYAML's load/dump\
  \ functions expect file-like objects or strings\u2014be explicit about converting\
  \ Path objects to str or using Path.open() to avoid subtle bugs."
- "For CLI argument parsing, Typer is more modern and ergonomic than argparse, especially\
  \ for async functions and type hints\u2014prefer Typer unless there's a strong reason\
  \ to stick with argparse."
