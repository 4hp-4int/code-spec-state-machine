requirements:
  functional:
  - Display a clear visual hierarchy for project state and workflow steps in the web
    UI.
  - Show real-time or near-real-time updates of coding project state (e.g., 'In Progress',
    'Blocked', 'Complete').
  - Provide a lightweight, interactive workflow tracker (state machine visualization)
    for agentic development steps.
  - Enable users to quickly see which specification steps are pending, active, or
    completed.
  - Allow filtering and sorting of project steps/specifications by status, priority,
    or type.
  - Highlight recent changes or updates to project state for better workflow visibility.
  - Ensure all enhancements are non-intrusive and maintain fast UI performance.
  non_functional:
  - Enhancements must be lightweight and not introduce significant load time or complexity.
  - UI must remain responsive and usable on typical solo developer hardware.
  - All new UI elements must be accessible and visually clear.
  - Changes must be configuration-driven where possible (no hard-coded values).
  - Maintain compatibility with existing file-based YAML storage and CLI workflows.
  - Comprehensive error handling for UI state and data loading failures.
  constraints:
  - Do not introduce new major dependencies without strong justification.
  - All UI changes must be backward compatible with current CLI and YAML workflows.
  - Follow established coding standards and file organization.
  - Use Python 3.12+ features where appropriate.
  - Maintain Windows compatibility (CRLF/LF handling).
  - All new code must be covered by unit tests.
  - Lint compliance must be maintained (ruff, pre-commit hooks).
implementation:
- task: Add visual hierarchy and workflow state indicators to the web UI
  details: Introduce clear headings, section dividers, and status badges for each
    project step/specification. Use color and iconography to distinguish between 'Pending',
    'Active', 'Blocked', and 'Complete' states. Ensure visual cues are accessible
    (color contrast, ARIA labels).
  files:
  - webui/components/StatusBadge.py
  - webui/components/WorkflowStepCard.py
  - webui/pages/ProjectDashboard.py
  - webui/static/styles.css
  acceptance: Project dashboard displays all steps/specs with clear, accessible status
    indicators and visual separation. Color and icon use passes accessibility checks.

- task: Implement a lightweight, interactive state machine visualization for workflow
    tracking
  details: Add a component that visualizes the current project workflow as a state
    machine graph. Use existing networkx/matplotlib for backend state modeling, and
    a simple JS or Python-based frontend for rendering. Allow users to click on states
    to view details.
  files:
  - webui/components/StateMachineGraph.py
  - webui/state_machine.py
  - webui/pages/ProjectDashboard.py
  - webui/static/state_machine.js
  acceptance: State machine graph is visible on the dashboard, accurately reflects
    project state, and supports basic interactivity (hover/click for details).

  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Enable filtering and sorting of project steps/specifications in the UI
  details: Add controls to filter steps/specs by status, priority, or type. Implement
    sorting options (e.g., by last updated, alphabetical). Ensure UI updates efficiently
    and maintains state.
  files:
  - webui/components/FilterSortControls.py
  - webui/pages/ProjectDashboard.py
  acceptance: User can filter and sort steps/specs; UI updates instantly and correctly
    reflects filter/sort criteria.

  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: atomic
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Highlight recent changes or updates to project state
  details: Visually mark steps/specs that have changed state or been updated recently
    (e.g., within the last 24 hours). Use subtle highlights or badges to avoid clutter.
  files:
  - webui/components/RecentChangeBadge.py
  - webui/pages/ProjectDashboard.py
  - webui/project_tracker.py
  acceptance: Recently updated steps/specs are visually highlighted; highlights fade
    or clear after a configurable period.

- task: Ensure all enhancements are configuration-driven and maintain CLI/YAML compatibility
  details: Refactor new UI features to read from configuration files where appropriate.
    Ensure all state and workflow data is sourced from existing YAML files and CLI
    outputs, not hard-coded.
  files:
  - webui/__init__.py
  - webui/project_tracker.py
  - webui/pages/ProjectDashboard.py
  acceptance: All new UI features can be toggled/configured via YAML or CLI flags;
    no hard-coded values for workflow/state logic.

  step_id: ed67766b:4
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: atomic
  progress: null

- task: Add unit tests for all new UI components and state logic
  details: Write tests covering rendering, interactivity, filtering, and state transitions
    for all new components and logic. Use existing test frameworks and follow codebase
    standards.
  files:
  - tests/test_webui.py
  acceptance: All new code paths are covered by tests; tests pass and maintain lint
    compliance.

review_notes:
- 'Missing Implementation Details: The spec assumes a Python-based web UI but does
  not clarify the web framework (e.g., Flask, FastAPI, or a custom solution). This
  is critical for implementing interactive components and integrating JS for state
  machine visualization. Clarify the frontend-backend integration pattern.'
- 'Technical Gotchas: Rendering interactive state machine graphs with networkx/matplotlib
  and exposing them to the frontend (with click/hover interactivity) is non-trivial.
  Consider using matplotlib to generate SVGs and layering JS for interactivity, or
  evaluate lightweight JS graph libraries if Python-side interactivity proves too
  limited.'
- 'Integration Points: Ensure that all state and workflow data is loaded from YAML/CLI
  outputs at runtime, not cached or hard-coded. Watch for race conditions or stale
  data if supporting near-real-time updates, especially if multiple sources can update
  the YAML.'
- 'Current Best Practices: All listed dependencies are current and well-maintained
  as of mid-2024. However, for accessibility (color contrast, ARIA), consider using
  a tool like axe-core or pa11y during development to catch issues early, since manual
  checks are easy to miss.'
