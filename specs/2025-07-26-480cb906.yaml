context:
  project: agentic-spec
  domain: Python CLI tool for AI-powered specification generation
  dependencies:
  - name: pre-commit
    description: Framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit
      hooks
    version: compatible with current pre-commit workflow
  files_involved:
  - .pre-commit-config.yaml
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - tests/
requirements:
  functional:
  - Automatically run `agentic-spec review` as a pre-commit hook before every commit.
  - Block commits if any specification files are incomplete or fail the review.
  - Provide clear, actionable error messages to the developer if the review fails.
  - Allow the hook to be bypassed with standard git mechanisms (e.g., --no-verify).
  non_functional:
  - Maintain compatibility with existing pre-commit hooks and workflows.
  - Ensure the hook runs efficiently to avoid slowing down the commit process.
  - Support both Windows (CRLF) and Unix (LF) line endings.
  - Provide comprehensive unit tests for hook logic and error handling.
  constraints:
  - Do not introduce new dependencies unless absolutely necessary; prefer shell or
    Python hooks.
  - "Do not modify the core agentic-spec review logic\u2014invoke it as a CLI command."
  - Keep all configuration in .pre-commit-config.yaml; do not hard-code paths.
  - Ensure the hook is non-blocking only if explicitly bypassed (e.g., with --no-verify).
  - Follow the existing codebase structure and coding standards.
implementation:
- task: Define a new pre-commit hook entry for agentic-spec review
  details: Add a new hook entry to .pre-commit-config.yaml that runs `agentic-spec
    review` on staged specification files (e.g., specs/*.yaml). Configure the hook
    to block commits if the review fails, and ensure it runs after linting/formatting
    hooks.
  files:
  - .pre-commit-config.yaml
  acceptance: The hook is listed in .pre-commit-config.yaml, runs automatically on
    commit, and blocks commits with incomplete or failing specs.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: 480cb906:0
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Implement a wrapper script for cross-platform compatibility (if needed)
  details: Create a lightweight Python or shell script (e.g., scripts/precommit_agentic_spec_review.py)
    to invoke `agentic-spec review` with proper environment handling, ensuring compatibility
    with both Windows and Unix systems. The script should exit with a non-zero status
    if the review fails.
  files:
  - scripts/precommit_agentic_spec_review.py
  acceptance: The script runs successfully on both Windows and Unix, invoking the
    CLI and propagating exit codes.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 480cb906:1
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Update documentation for the new pre-commit hook
  details: Add clear instructions to the README and/or CONTRIBUTING.md on the purpose
    of the agentic-spec review hook, how to resolve failures, and how to bypass the
    hook if necessary.
  files:
  - README.md
  - CONTRIBUTING.md
  acceptance: Documentation clearly explains the hook's function, troubleshooting
    steps, and bypass instructions.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: 480cb906:2
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Write unit tests for the pre-commit hook logic
  details: Add tests to ensure the hook correctly invokes agentic-spec review, blocks
    commits on failure, and handles edge cases (e.g., no spec files staged, review
    CLI errors). Use mocking to simulate CLI behavior.
  files:
  - tests/test_precommit_agentic_spec_review.py
  acceptance: Tests cover success, failure, and edge cases; all tests pass in CI.

review_notes:
- Ensure the wrapper script for invoking `agentic-spec review` is cross-platform by
  using a shebang like `#!/usr/bin/env python` and handling path separators with `os.path.join`
  to maintain compatibility across different operating systems. ([stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72290449/conditional-shebang-for-git-hooks-cross-platform?utm_source=openai),
  [github.com](https://github.com/AdnanEkici/pre-commit-platform-safe-path-enforcer?utm_source=openai))
- To avoid potential issues with hard-coded paths in the pre-commit hook configuration,
  consider using relative paths or environment variables to specify the location of
  the wrapper script, ensuring flexibility and portability. ([stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78852017/pre-commit-using-mypy-specify-venv-cross-platform?utm_source=openai))
- Incorporate comprehensive error handling in the wrapper script to manage scenarios
  where `agentic-spec review` encounters issues, providing clear and actionable error
  messages to the developer. ([kinsta.com](https://kinsta.com/blog/git-hooks/?utm_source=openai))
- Regularly update the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file using `pre-commit autoupdate`
  to ensure all hooks, including the new `agentic-spec review` hook, are using the
  latest versions, maintaining compatibility and benefiting from recent improvements.
