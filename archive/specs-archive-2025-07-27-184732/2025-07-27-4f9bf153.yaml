  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/prompt_engineering.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Refactor code to reduce cyclomatic complexity and improve logical flow.
  - Enhance code readability by applying consistent formatting and naming conventions.
  - Ensure all functions and classes use Python type hints.
  - Replace mutable default arguments with None pattern where applicable.
  - Centralize configuration-driven behavior and remove hard-coded values.
  - Improve error handling with informative, non-literal exception messages.
  - Add or update docstrings for all public functions and classes.
  - Write or update unit tests to cover refactored code paths.
  non_functional:
  - Maintain full compatibility with Python 3.12+.
  - Ensure all changes pass pre-commit hooks and linting (ruff, ruff-format).
  - Preserve existing CLI interface and user-facing behaviors.
  - Maintain or improve test coverage for all refactored modules.
  - Ensure Windows compatibility (CRLF/LF handling).
  constraints:
  - Do not introduce new dependencies unless absolutely necessary and justified.
  - Follow established codebase structure and file organization.
  - Adhere to project coding standards (dataclasses, Pydantic, async/await, pathlib.Path,
    etc.).
  - Do not break existing API or CLI contracts.
  - All configuration must be file-based and human-readable (YAML).
  - Maintain lint error count below 30.
  - All error messages must be informative and avoid string literals in raise statements.
implementation:
- task: Analyze and document current complexity hotspots
  details: Use static analysis tools (e.g., ruff, pylint, or built-in Python tools)
    to identify functions and classes with high cyclomatic complexity or deep nesting.
    Document these hotspots and prioritize them for refactoring.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/prompt_engineering.py
  acceptance: A markdown or YAML summary of complexity hotspots is created and added
    to the project root or docs directory.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: 4f9bf153:0
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Refactor complex functions and classes
  details: Break down large functions into smaller, single-responsibility functions.
    Extract repeated logic into helper functions or methods. Ensure all refactored
    code uses type hints and follows naming conventions.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/prompt_engineering.py
  acceptance: All identified hotspots are refactored, and code passes linting and
    tests. No function exceeds a reasonable complexity threshold (e.g., cyclomatic
    complexity <10).
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 4f9bf153:1
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Standardize error handling and messaging
  details: Review all exception raising and handling. Replace string literals in raise
    statements with properly formatted exception messages. Ensure all errors provide
    actionable information for the user or developer.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/prompt_engineering.py
  acceptance: All error messages are informative, consistent, and compliant with project
    standards. No string literals are used directly in raise statements.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: 4f9bf153:2
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Centralize and externalize configuration
  details: Identify hard-coded values (e.g., file paths, API parameters, thresholds)
    and move them to configuration files or constants modules. Ensure all configuration
    is loaded from YAML files using pathlib.Path.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/prompt_engineering.py
  - agentic_spec/config.py
  acceptance: All configuration is file-based and human-readable. No hard-coded values
    remain in the main logic files.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 4f9bf153:3
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Update and expand docstrings and inline documentation
  details: Ensure all public functions, classes, and modules have clear, concise docstrings
    following PEP 257. Add inline comments where logic is non-obvious.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/prompt_engineering.py
  acceptance: All public interfaces are documented. Docstrings are present and pass
    linting checks.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: 4f9bf153:4
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Write or update unit tests for refactored code
  details: Ensure all new or modified functions are covered by unit tests. Use mocking
    for async/await and external API calls. Maintain or improve overall test coverage.
  files:
  - tests/
  acceptance: All tests pass, and coverage reports show no decrease in coverage. New
    logic is properly tested.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 4f9bf153:5
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Run and verify pre-commit hooks and linting
  details: Run make lint, make format, and make quality-gate to ensure all code changes
    comply with project standards. Fix any issues reported by pre-commit hooks.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/prompt_engineering.py
  acceptance: No new linting errors are introduced. All pre-commit hooks pass without
    blocking warnings.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: 4f9bf153:6
  sub_spec_id: null
review_notes:
- "The spec assumes static analysis tools (like ruff or pylint) are already configured,\
  \ but does not specify which complexity metric or threshold tool to use\u2014clarify\
  \ which tool and config to standardize results and avoid ambiguity."
- "Moving all configuration to YAML is practical, but ensure that dynamic or secret\
  \ values (e.g., API keys) are handled securely and not just dumped into plain YAML\u2014\
  consider documenting how to handle secrets."
- Refactoring for complexity reduction may impact function signatures and internal
  logic; ensure that all CLI and API contracts are covered by regression tests to
  catch accidental breakage, especially since the CLI interface must not change.
- "No mention is made of how to handle legacy or deprecated code paths during refactoring\u2014\
  add a step to identify and either update or clearly deprecate such paths to avoid\
  \ silent breakage."
