  project: agentic-spec CLI Enhancement
  domain: Python CLI tool for specification generation
  dependencies:
  - Typer
  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Redesign CLI commands using Typer to simplify interactions.
  - Provide clear help messages and documentation for each command.
  non_functional:
  - Ensure the CLI is intuitive and user-friendly.
  - Maintain consistency with existing project architecture and standards.
  constraints:
  - Adhere to common CLI conventions, such as using `--help` and `--version` options.
  - Ensure compatibility with existing dependencies and avoid introducing unnecessary
    new ones.
implementation:
- task: Integrate Typer into the CLI application.
  details: Replace the existing CLI framework with Typer to leverage its capabilities
    for creating user-friendly command-line interfaces.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: The CLI application initializes without errors using Typer as the command-line
    interface framework.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 1d504bb6:0
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Redesign CLI commands for simplicity and intuitiveness.
  details: Refactor existing commands to follow a verb-noun naming convention (e.g.,
    `generate-spec`, `validate-input`) and ensure they are easily understandable.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: All CLI commands are refactored to follow the verb-noun naming convention
    and are intuitive to the user.
  estimated_effort: medium

- task: Implement clear and comprehensive help messages for each command.
  details: Utilize Typer's `help` parameter to provide detailed descriptions for each
    command and its arguments, ensuring users can easily understand their usage.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: Running `--help` for each command displays clear and comprehensive descriptions
    of the command and its arguments.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: 1d504bb6:2
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Ensure adherence to common CLI conventions.
  details: Implement standard options such as `--help` and `--version`, and ensure
    that optional arguments are prefixed with `--` while required arguments are positional.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: The CLI application includes standard options like `--help` and `--version`,
    and follows common conventions for argument formatting.

- Implement comprehensive error handling within each command to provide informative
  messages and prevent unexpected behavior, enhancing user experience. ([coderivers.org](https://coderivers.org/blog/python-typer/?utm_source=openai))
- Utilize Typer's support for environment variables to allow default values for command
  arguments, enhancing flexibility and user convenience. ([rahulpai.co.uk](https://rahulpai.co.uk/smart-clis-with-typer.html?utm_source=openai))
- Ensure that the CLI application adheres to common conventions, such as using `--help`
  and `--version` options, and follows standard argument formatting to maintain consistency
  and user-friendliness. ([projectrules.ai](https://www.projectrules.ai/rules/typer?utm_source=openai))
