review_notes:
- '**Missing Implementation Details**: The specification lacks a clear plan for integrating
  the semantic caching library into `core.py`. Define how the new caching system will
  interface with existing functions and data structures.'
- '**Technical Gotchas**: Implementing context deduplication requires careful handling
  to prevent reloading foundational templates multiple times per session. Ensure that
  the caching mechanism accurately identifies and manages duplicate contexts without
  introducing inconsistencies.'
- '**Current Best Practices**: Consider using well-maintained semantic caching libraries
  like GPTCache ([github.com](https://github.com/zilliztech/gptcache?utm_source=openai))
  or SemantiCache ([pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/SemantiCache/?utm_source=openai)).
  These libraries offer modular designs and support for various embedding models,
  which can streamline integration and future maintenance.'
