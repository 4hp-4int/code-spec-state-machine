requirements:
  functional:
  - Develop a REST API service to handle AI-powered specification generation requests.
  - Implement endpoints for creating, retrieving, and listing specifications.
  - Validate incoming request data using Pydantic models.
  - Ensure asynchronous processing of requests to handle concurrent operations efficiently.
  non_functional:
  - Maintain high performance and responsiveness under concurrent load.
  - Provide clear and informative error messages for invalid requests.
  - Ensure the API is secure and does not expose sensitive information.
  - Generate automatic interactive API documentation.
  constraints:
  - Use FastAPI for building the REST API service.
  - Ensure compatibility with Python 3.12+.
  - Store all data in human-readable YAML format without using external databases.
  - Maintain Windows compatibility, including proper handling of line endings.
  - Adhere to existing coding standards and design patterns of the agentic-spec project.
implementation:
- task: Set up the FastAPI application.
  details: Initialize a FastAPI application instance in a new module named api.py
    within the agentic_spec package.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/api.py
  acceptance: A FastAPI application instance is created and ready to define routes.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: 6f8d545f:0
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Define Pydantic models for request and response validation.
  details: Create Pydantic models in models.py to represent the structure of specifications
    and ensure data validation.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  acceptance: Pydantic models are defined and imported into api.py for use in request
    validation.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 6f8d545f:1
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Implement the endpoint to create a new specification.
  details: Add a POST endpoint in api.py that accepts a specification request, validates
    it using the Pydantic model, and stores it in a YAML file.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/api.py
  acceptance: The endpoint successfully creates and stores a new specification in
    YAML format upon receiving valid data.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 6f8d545f:2
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Implement the endpoint to retrieve an existing specification.
  details: Add a GET endpoint in api.py that retrieves a specification by its unique
    identifier from the YAML storage.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/api.py
  acceptance: The endpoint returns the requested specification data when provided
    with a valid identifier.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 6f8d545f:3
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Implement the endpoint to list all specifications.
  details: Add a GET endpoint in api.py that lists all stored specifications with
    their identifiers.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/api.py
  acceptance: The endpoint returns a list of all specifications with their identifiers.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: 6f8d545f:4
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Ensure asynchronous processing of API requests.
  details: Use async def for all endpoint functions and ensure that file I/O operations
    are performed asynchronously to handle concurrent requests efficiently.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/api.py
  acceptance: All endpoints are implemented as asynchronous functions, and the API
    handles concurrent requests without blocking.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 6f8d545f:5
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Implement error handling and validation.
  details: Add error handling to return informative messages for invalid requests
    and handle exceptions gracefully.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/api.py
  acceptance: The API returns clear error messages for invalid requests and handles
    exceptions without exposing sensitive information.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 6f8d545f:6
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Generate automatic interactive API documentation.
  details: Leverage FastAPI's automatic documentation generation to provide interactive
    API documentation accessible via the /docs endpoint.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/api.py
  acceptance: Interactive API documentation is available and accurately reflects the
    implemented endpoints and models.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: 6f8d545f:7
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Write unit tests for the API endpoints.
  details: Develop unit tests in test_api.py to verify the functionality of each endpoint,
    including handling of valid and invalid requests.
  files:
  - tests/test_api.py
  acceptance: All API endpoints are covered by unit tests, and tests pass successfully.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 6f8d545f:8
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Integrate the API service with the existing CLI tool.
  details: Modify the CLI tool to interact with the new API service for specification
    generation tasks.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: The CLI tool successfully communicates with the API service to perform
    specification generation tasks.
  estimated_effort: high

review_notes:
- Ensure that all file I/O operations, such as reading and writing YAML files, are
  performed asynchronously using libraries like `aiofiles` to prevent blocking the
  event loop. ([blog.poespas.me](https://blog.poespas.me/posts/2024/05/19/handling-file-uploads-in-fastapi-with-async-io/?utm_source=openai))
- When defining asynchronous endpoints, avoid using synchronous operations within
  them, as this can block the event loop and degrade performance. ([fastapi.tiangolo.com](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/async/?utm_source=openai))
- For CPU-bound tasks, consider using background tasks or external task queues like
  Celery to prevent blocking the main event loop. ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40ramanbazhanau/preparing-fastapi-for-production-a-comprehensive-guide-d167e693aa2b?utm_source=openai))
- Ensure that all third-party libraries used in the project support asynchronous operations
  to fully leverage FastAPI's async capabilities. ([sirin.dev](https://www.sirin.dev/Programming/Guide/FastAPI-Python-Programming?utm_source=openai))
