  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - tests/test_core.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Verify that the database auto-save functionality works as intended after the recent
    fix.
  - Ensure that data is automatically saved to the YAML file when expected operations
    are performed.
  - Test should simulate a realistic workflow that triggers auto-save.
  non_functional:
  - Test must be isolated and not affect existing data files.
  - Test should provide clear error messages if auto-save fails.
  - Test must be compatible with the current async test suite and mocking patterns.
  constraints:
  - Do not introduce new dependencies.
  - Follow existing file organization and naming conventions.
  - Maintain lint compliance and adhere to pre-commit hooks.
  - Use Python 3.12+ features and type hints.
  - Store all test data in temporary files or use mocking to avoid persistent changes.
implementation:
- task: Add a unit test to verify database auto-save fix
  details: Implement a new test in tests/test_core.py that exercises the auto-save
    logic in agentic_spec/core.py. The test should simulate a typical operation that
    triggers auto-save (e.g., updating or adding a specification), then verify that
    the expected YAML file is updated accordingly. Use temporary files or mocking
    to avoid modifying real data. Ensure the test is async if the auto-save logic
    is async, and use pytest's async support and mocking utilities as needed.
  files:
  - tests/test_core.py
  acceptance: Test reliably fails if auto-save is broken and passes if auto-save works.
    No persistent files are left after test run. Test is lint- and style-compliant.

review_notes:
- Clarify whether the auto-save logic in agentic_spec/core.py is synchronous or asynchronous;
  this impacts whether to use pytest-asyncio and async mocks in the test.
- Ensure the test uses Python's tempfile or pytest's tmp_path fixture to create temporary
  YAML files, preventing any accidental writes to real data.
- If the auto-save logic interacts with file I/O directly, consider using unittest.mock
  to patch open or the file-writing method, so the test can assert file content without
  leaving artifacts.
- Check that the test covers both the trigger (e.g., update/add operation) and the
  verification (YAML file content), and that it cleans up any temporary files or mocks
  after execution.
