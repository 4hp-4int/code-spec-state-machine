  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  - agentic_spec/db.py
  - agentic_spec/migrations/
requirements:
  functional:
  - Define data models for specifications, tasks, approvals, and work logs using Pydantic
    and dataclasses.
  - Ensure all relevant metadata from YAML specifications is preserved in the models.
  - Support extensibility for future fields (e.g., approval levels, timestamps, notes).
  - Provide migration scaffolding for evolving schema.
  - Enable serialization/deserialization to/from YAML-compatible structures.
  non_functional:
  - Models must be easy to extend and maintain.
  - Schema changes should be trackable and reversible.
  - All models must include comprehensive type hints and docstrings.
  - Maintain compatibility with file-based storage (no external DB).
  constraints:
  - Use only Python 3.12+ features.
  - Do not introduce external database dependencies.
  - Follow existing codebase structure and coding standards.
  - Preserve all YAML metadata in model fields.
  - Ensure Windows compatibility for all file operations.
implementation:
- task: Analyze YAML specification structure and metadata requirements
  details: Review existing YAML specification files and templates to enumerate all
    metadata fields that must be represented in the data models. Document required
    and optional fields for specifications, tasks, approvals, and work logs.
  files:
  - templates/
  - specs/
  acceptance: Comprehensive list of all metadata fields and their types is documented;
    edge cases and optional fields are identified.

  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: atomic
- task: Design Pydantic and dataclass models for specifications, tasks, approvals,
    and work logs
  details: Define Python models in agentic_spec/models.py using Pydantic and dataclasses.
    Ensure all fields from the metadata analysis are represented. Include extensibility
    hooks (e.g., extra fields, future-proof enums). Add type hints and docstrings
    for all models.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  acceptance: Models are defined with all required fields, type hints, and docstrings;
    extensibility is demonstrated via at least one optional/extra field.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 2a695a8f:1
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: covers multiple related models and extensibility
    patterns'
- task: Implement serialization and deserialization logic for YAML compatibility
  details: Add methods to models or utility functions to serialize/deserialize between
    Python objects and YAML-compatible dicts. Ensure round-trip fidelity for all metadata
    fields, including nested and optional fields.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  acceptance: All models can be serialized to and from YAML-compatible dicts with
    no data loss; unit tests cover round-trip scenarios.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 2a695a8f:2
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: atomic
- task: Scaffold migration system for schema evolution
  details: Create initial migration scripts or documentation in agentic_spec/migrations/
    to track changes to data models over time. Provide a template for future migrations
    and instructions for applying/reverting changes.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/migrations/
  acceptance: Migration scaffolding exists with at least one example migration and
    clear instructions; supports tracking and rollback.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: 2a695a8f:3
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: atomic
- task: Integrate models with file-based storage logic
  details: Update or create functions in agentic_spec/db.py to read/write model instances
    to YAML files, ensuring all metadata is preserved and extensibility is supported.
    Handle errors gracefully and maintain Windows compatibility.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/db.py
  acceptance: Models can be persisted and loaded from YAML files with all fields intact;
    error handling and Windows compatibility are verified.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 2a695a8f:4
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: involves both read and write logic, plus error handling'
- task: Write unit tests for all models and serialization logic
  details: Add tests to verify model validation, serialization/deserialization, and
    file I/O. Cover edge cases such as missing optional fields, extra metadata, and
    schema changes.
  files:
  - tests/
  acceptance: Tests cover all models and serialization paths; edge cases and error
    conditions are included; tests pass in CI.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 2a695a8f:5
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: covers multiple models and scenarios'
review_notes:
- Ensure that Pydantic v2.11 or later is used to maintain compatibility with Python
  3.12 and to leverage new features like support for PEP 695 and PEP 696. ([pydantic.dev](https://pydantic.dev/articles/pydantic-v2-11-release?utm_source=openai))
- Implement robust error handling in file operations within `agentic_spec/db.py` to
  ensure compatibility across different operating systems, particularly Windows.
- Develop a clear and simple migration system in `agentic_spec/migrations/` to track
  schema changes over time, providing templates and instructions for applying and
  reverting migrations.
- Include comprehensive unit tests covering model validation, serialization/deserialization,
  and file I/O, addressing edge cases such as missing optional fields and extra metadata
  to ensure reliability.
