review_notes:
- Ensure all caching mechanisms, including SQLite database operations, cache-related
  methods, configurations, and dependencies, are thoroughly identified and removed
  to prevent residual caching behavior.
- Review the codebase for any implicit caching, such as in-memory caches or third-party
  libraries that may cache data by default, and disable or remove these to ensure
  direct API calls.
- After removing caching, monitor the application's performance and API usage to assess
  the impact on response times and costs, and consider implementing rate limiting
  or batching strategies if necessary.
