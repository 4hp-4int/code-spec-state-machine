  - docs/architecture.md
  - docs/usage.md
  - docs/development.md
  - docs/api_reference.md
requirements:
  functional:
  - Provide a clear, concise, and comprehensive README.md with user-facing summaries,
    installation instructions, and quickstart examples.
  - Create technical documentation for developers, including architecture overview,
    codebase structure, development workflows, and API reference.
  - Document configuration options, template inheritance patterns, and error handling
    strategies.
  - Ensure all documentation is accessible and understandable for solo developers
    with intermediate Python experience.
  non_functional:
  - Documentation must be easy to navigate and maintain, using Markdown format.
  - All technical docs should be human-readable and version-controlled within the
    repository.
  - Documentation must reflect the latest codebase state and coding standards.
  - Ensure documentation is compatible with Windows and Unix line endings.
  constraints:
  - Do not introduce new dependencies for documentation generation.
  - All documentation must be stored in the repository (no external hosting).
  - Follow the established file organization and naming conventions.
  - Documentation must not conflict with existing codebase or project requirements.
implementation:
- task: Revise and expand README.md
  details: Update README.md to include a project summary, key features, installation
    steps, quickstart usage, example commands, and links to further documentation.
    Emphasize solo developer workflows and Windows compatibility.
  files:
  - README.md
  acceptance: README.md provides a clear overview, accurate instructions, and is free
    of outdated or missing information.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: '81798921:0'
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Create docs/overview.md
  details: Write a high-level overview of the agentic-spec project, its purpose, and
    its main capabilities. Include a summary of the AI-powered specification workflow
    and template inheritance.
  files:
  - docs/overview.md
  acceptance: Overview is concise, accurate, and understandable to new users.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: '81798921:1'
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Document architecture and codebase structure
  details: Create docs/architecture.md describing the main modules, their responsibilities,
    and how they interact. Include a diagram or text-based outline of the codebase
    structure.
  files:
  - docs/architecture.md
  acceptance: Architecture documentation matches the current codebase and highlights
    key design patterns.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: '81798921:2'
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Write detailed usage guide
  details: Develop docs/usage.md with step-by-step instructions for common tasks,
    CLI commands, configuration options, and troubleshooting tips. Include examples
    for both basic and advanced usage.
  files:
  - docs/usage.md
  acceptance: Usage guide covers all major workflows and is validated against the
    current CLI interface.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: '81798921:3'
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Document development workflows and contribution guidelines
  details: Create docs/development.md covering coding standards, pre-commit hooks,
    testing, linting, and the make-based workflow. Include instructions for running
    and updating specs, and guidelines for contributing.
  files:
  - docs/development.md
  acceptance: Development documentation is clear, actionable, and aligned with current
    workflows.

  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Generate API reference documentation
  details: Write docs/api_reference.md summarizing the public API of the main modules
    (functions, classes, CLI commands). Use docstrings and code comments as the source
    of truth.
  files:
  - docs/api_reference.md
  acceptance: API reference is accurate, up-to-date, and covers all user-facing interfaces.

review_notes:
- 'Missing Implementation Details: The spec does not clarify how to validate that
  documentation (especially API reference and usage examples) stays in sync with the
  evolving codebase. Consider specifying a manual review checklist or a script to
  flag outdated docstrings or CLI command changes.'
- 'Technical Gotchas: Windows compatibility is emphasized, but no mention is made
  of handling path separators, shell command differences, or line ending normalization
  in documentation examples. Explicitly test and document any platform-specific quirks,
  especially for CLI usage and make-based workflows.'
- 'Integration Points: If the codebase is still evolving, ensure that architecture
  and API docs are generated or updated after major refactors. Otherwise, these docs
  will quickly become stale and misleading.'
- "Quick Wins: For API reference, leverage existing docstrings and code comments directly\u2014\
  avoid duplicating information manually. Tools like pydoc or Sphinx (without new\
  \ dependencies) can help extract this, or provide a simple script to automate doc\
  \ extraction."
