context:
  project: agentic-spec
  domain: Python CLI tool for AI-powered specification generation and task tracking
  dependencies:

  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/db.py
  - tests/test_db.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Persist task progress and approval data to YAML files
  - Read task progress and approval data from YAML files
  - Ensure atomic file updates to prevent data corruption
  - Support cross-platform file operations (Windows/Unix)
  - Expose clear async API for reading and writing task data
  non_functional:
  - Comprehensive error handling with informative messages
  - Unit tests for all persistence functions
  - Maintain human-readable YAML format for all stored data
  constraints:
  - Use pathlib.Path for all file operations
  - Do not introduce new dependencies beyond those specified
  - Maintain compatibility with Python 3.12+
  - Avoid external databases; file-based only
  - Follow project coding standards and linting rules
implementation:
- task: Design YAML schema for task progress and approval data
  details: Define a clear, extensible YAML structure for storing task progress and
    approval status. Document schema fields and provide example YAML.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/db.py
  acceptance: Schema is documented in code comments and example YAML is included in
    the docstring or as a test fixture.

- task: Implement async function to read task data from YAML file
  details: Create an async function that loads task progress and approval data from
    a YAML file using pathlib.Path. Handle missing or malformed files gracefully.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/db.py
  acceptance: Function returns correct data structure or raises informative error;
    unit tests cover normal and error cases.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 5fe71618:1
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: atomic
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Implement async function to write task data to YAML file with atomic update
  details: Create an async function that writes task progress and approval data to
    a YAML file, ensuring atomicity (e.g., write to temp file then move). Use pathlib.Path
    for all operations.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/db.py
  acceptance: File updates are atomic and data is never corrupted; unit tests simulate
    interrupted writes and verify integrity.

  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: atomic
  progress: null

- task: Implement cross-platform file locking or safe-write mechanism
  details: Ensure that concurrent writes do not corrupt data. Use a cross-platform
    approach (e.g., atomic file move, or advisory lock if needed). Document approach
    and limitations.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/db.py
  acceptance: Mechanism prevents data corruption on both Windows and Unix; tests verify
    correct behavior under simulated concurrent access.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 5fe71618:3
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: atomic
  progress: null

- task: Add comprehensive error handling and informative exception messages
  details: Wrap file operations with try/except blocks, raise custom exceptions with
    clear messages, and ensure all errors are logged or surfaced appropriately.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/db.py
  acceptance: All error cases are handled gracefully; exception messages are informative
    and tested.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: 5fe71618:4
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: atomic
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Write unit tests for all persistence functions
  details: Create tests for reading, writing, atomicity, error handling, and schema
    validation. Use temporary files and mock failures where appropriate.
  files:
  - tests/test_db.py
  acceptance: All functions are covered by tests; tests pass and cover normal, edge,
    and error cases.

review_notes:
- The spec requires async file I/O, but PyYAML does not natively support async operations.
  You'll need to run YAML load/dump in a thread pool (e.g., asyncio.to_thread) to
  avoid blocking the event loop.
- 'Atomic file writes using pathlib and standard library only: use tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False)
  in the same directory, then pathlib.Path.replace() for atomic move. Be aware that
  atomicity guarantees differ slightly between Windows and Unix; document any edge
  cases.'
- Cross-platform file locking is tricky without external dependencies. The standard
  library lacks a robust, cross-platform advisory lock. Consider using a simple lock
  file pattern (e.g., .lock file with exclusive creation), but document race condition
  risks and limitations.
- 'Schema documentation and example YAML: include a minimal, valid YAML example in
  the module docstring and as a test fixture. Validate schema in code (e.g., required
  fields) since YAML is permissive and errors may be silent otherwise.'
