    detail (with approval/timeline), and static asset serving.
  - Render HTML views using Jinja2 templates for all endpoints.
  - Support filtering of tasks by status, date range, and project via query parameters.
  - Display task approval status and timeline in task detail view.
  - Serve static assets (CSS, JS, images) from a dedicated endpoint.
  non_functional:
  - Ensure endpoints return informative error messages on failure.
  - Maintain code readability and modularity for solo developer workflows.
  - Support Windows and cross-platform file path handling for static assets and templates.
  - Ensure all views are responsive and accessible for basic usability.
  constraints:
  - Do not introduce new dependencies outside those already listed.
  - Use only Jinja2 for templating.
  - Store all templates in agentic_spec/web_templates/.
  - Follow established coding standards (async/await, type hints, error handling,
    etc.).
  - Do not use external databases; rely on file-based or in-memory data.
implementation:
- task: Scaffold web UI entrypoint and routing logic
  details: Create the initial web_ui.py module with a minimal async web server setup
    (e.g., using Typer or a minimal ASGI framework if already present in codebase).
    Define route handlers for project list, task list, task detail, and static asset
    serving. Ensure all routes are registered and return placeholder responses.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/web_ui.py
  acceptance: web_ui.py contains route handlers for all required endpoints, each returning
    a basic response; server can be started and responds to all routes.

- task: Implement task list endpoint with filtering and view
  details: Develop the endpoint to list tasks, supporting filtering by status, date
    range, and project via query parameters. Load and filter task data accordingly.
    Render the filtered task list using a Jinja2 template.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/web_ui.py
  - agentic_spec/web_templates/task_list.html
  acceptance: GET /tasks returns an HTML page listing tasks, with filters applied
    as per query parameters; template displays all relevant task fields.

- task: Implement task detail endpoint with approval and timeline view
  details: Develop the endpoint to display detailed information for a single task,
    including approval status and a timeline of events/updates. Render the detail
    using a Jinja2 template.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/web_ui.py
  - agentic_spec/web_templates/task_detail.html
  acceptance: GET /tasks/<task_id> returns an HTML page with all task details, approval
    status, and timeline; template renders correctly for valid and invalid IDs.

- task: Implement static asset serving endpoint
  details: Add an endpoint to serve static files (CSS, JS, images) from a designated
    directory. Ensure correct MIME types and path handling for Windows compatibility.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/web_ui.py
  - agentic_spec/web_templates/static/
  acceptance: Static assets are accessible via HTTP; assets load correctly in all
    HTML views; no path errors on Windows.

    in the web_templates directory. Ensure templates are modular, readable, and support
    all required data fields and UI elements.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/web_templates/project_list.html
  - agentic_spec/web_templates/task_list.html

review_notes:
- Consider using FastAPI instead of Typer for the web server implementation. FastAPI
  is a modern, high-performance web framework that supports asynchronous programming
  and integrates seamlessly with Jinja2 for templating. It also provides automatic
  OpenAPI documentation, which can be beneficial for API development. This approach
  aligns with current best practices and offers robust support for building web applications.
  ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FastAPI?utm_source=openai))
- Ensure that the Jinja2 version is updated to the latest stable release to benefit
  from recent security patches and features. As of June 2024, Jinja2 version 3.1.2
  is available. Regularly updating dependencies is crucial for maintaining application
  security and performance.
- Implement comprehensive error handling in the web_ui.py module. This includes returning
  appropriate HTTP status codes and user-friendly error messages for scenarios such
  as missing resources (404), invalid filters (400), and internal server errors (500).
  Proper error handling enhances the user experience and aids in debugging.
- Develop unit and integration tests for all endpoints and views using pytest. Testing
  should cover normal and error cases to ensure the application behaves as expected
  under various conditions. This practice helps in identifying issues early and maintaining
  code quality.
