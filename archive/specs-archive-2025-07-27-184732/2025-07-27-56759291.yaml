  project: agentic-spec
  domain: Python CLI tool for AI-powered specification generation
  dependencies:

      web UI')
  - name: jinja2

  files_involved:
  - webui/main.py
  - webui/templates/base.html
  - webui/templates/index.html
  - webui/templates/spec_detail.html
  - webui/templates/task_detail.html
  - webui/static/styles.css
requirements:
  functional:
  - Improve overall layout and visual styling of the FastAPI web UI using CSS (no
    JS frameworks).
  - Add a persistent navigation bar with links to Home, Specs, Tasks, and About.
  - Ensure all tables listing specs or tasks have clickable rows or cells that hyperlink
    to their respective detail pages.
  - Display contextual metadata (e.g., spec/task status, last updated, parent-child
    relationships) on relevant pages.
  - Polish user experience for clarity and ease of navigation, maintaining accessibility.
  non_functional:
  - Do not introduce any JavaScript frameworks; use only vanilla JS if absolutely
    necessary.
  - Maintain compatibility with modern browsers and ensure responsive design.
  - Keep all UI code and assets organized under the webui/ directory.
  - Ensure all changes are covered by unit or integration tests where feasible.
  - Maintain clear separation of concerns between backend logic and UI presentation.
  constraints:
  - Do not add new dependencies outside of those already present in the codebase.
  - All styling must be handled via CSS (preferably a single styles.css file).
  - All navigation and linking must be server-rendered (no client-side routing).
  - Follow existing coding standards and file organization patterns.
  - Ensure all new or modified files pass linting and pre-commit hooks.
implementation:
- task: Refactor base Jinja2 template to include a persistent navigation bar and improved
    layout structure.
  details: Update base.html to add a top navigation bar with links to Home, Specs,
    Tasks, and About. Refactor layout to use semantic HTML5 elements and ensure consistent
    header/footer across all pages.
  files:
  - webui/templates/base.html
  acceptance: Navigation bar is visible on all pages; layout is visually consistent;
    links route correctly.

- task: Update spec and task list templates to hyperlink table rows/cells to detail
    pages.
  details: Modify index.html and any list views to ensure each spec/task row or cell
    is a clickable link to its detail page. Use semantic HTML for accessibility.

  details: Update spec_detail.html and task_detail.html to show metadata such as status,
    last updated, parent/child relationships, and any relevant tags. Use visually
    distinct sections for metadata.
  files:
  - webui/templates/spec_detail.html
  - webui/templates/task_detail.html

review_notes:
- 'Missing Implementation Details: The spec assumes all necessary context (e.g., navigation
  links, metadata) is available in main.py route handlers, but does not specify the
  data model or how parent/child relationships and tags are structured. Clarify expected
  data structures and ensure all required fields are passed to templates.'
- "Technical Gotchas: Making entire table rows clickable with semantic HTML can be\
  \ tricky for accessibility\u2014prefer <a> tags inside <td> elements and use ARIA\
  \ attributes as needed. Test keyboard navigation and screen reader behavior."
- 'Integration Points: Refactoring base.html for a persistent nav bar may require
  updating all templates that extend it to avoid layout breakage. Review all template
  inheritance and block usage to ensure consistency.'
- 'Current Best Practices: FastAPI and Jinja2 are current and well-supported. For
  CSS, consider using CSS custom properties for theming and ensure styles.css is loaded
  with cache-busting in production. Avoid inline styles or scattered CSS.'
