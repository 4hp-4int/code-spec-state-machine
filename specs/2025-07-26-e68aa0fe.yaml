review_notes:
- Ensure that the `pyproject.toml` file includes a `[build-system]` table specifying
  `setuptools` as the build backend, as this is essential for modern Python packaging
  standards. ([packaging.python.org](https://packaging.python.org/guides/modernize-setup-py-project/?utm_source=openai))
- Retain a minimal `setup.py` file to maintain compatibility with legacy tools and
  workflows that may still rely on it. ([packaging.python.org](https://packaging.python.org/guides/modernize-setup-py-project/?utm_source=openai))
- Verify that all static project metadata, such as name, version, and dependencies,
  are accurately defined under the `[project]` table in `pyproject.toml` to adhere
  to PEP 621 standards. ([packaging.python.org](https://packaging.python.org/guides/modernize-setup-py-project/?utm_source=openai))
- Update project documentation to reflect the migration to `pyproject.toml`, ensuring
  that all references to `setup.py` and `setup.cfg` are revised to prevent confusion.
