context:
  project: agentic-spec CLI Enhancement
  domain: Python CLI tool for specification generation
  dependencies:
  - name: PyYAML
    version: 6.0.1
    description: A YAML parser and emitter for Python
  - name: Click
    version: 8.1.3
    description: A package for creating command-line interfaces

  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/config.yaml
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/config.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Load default workflow configurations from a YAML file.
  - Allow users to override default configurations via command-line arguments.
  - Validate configuration data to ensure correctness and prevent errors.
  non_functional:
  - Ensure the configuration system is user-friendly and intuitive.
  - Maintain high performance and low latency in configuration loading and validation.
  constraints:
  - Use only stable and well-maintained Python libraries.
  - Ensure compatibility with Python 3.10 and above.
implementation:
- task: Define Configuration Schema
  details: Utilize Pydantic to create a schema that defines the structure and types
    of the configuration data. This schema will serve as the blueprint for validating
    the configuration loaded from the YAML file.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/config.py
  acceptance: A Pydantic model is created that accurately represents the configuration
    structure, including all necessary fields and their types.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: e20838a2:0
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Implement Configuration Loader
  details: Develop a function that reads the YAML configuration file using PyYAML,
    parses its content, and validates it against the Pydantic schema. This function
    should handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/config.py
  acceptance: The function successfully loads and validates the configuration file,
    raising appropriate errors for invalid configurations.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: e20838a2:1
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Integrate Command-Line Overrides
  details: Enhance the CLI to accept configuration overrides as command-line arguments
    using Click. These overrides should be parsed and merged with the default configuration,
    with command-line arguments taking precedence.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: Command-line arguments are correctly parsed and override the corresponding
    configuration settings.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: e20838a2:2
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Implement Configuration Merging Logic
  details: Develop logic to merge the default configuration with any overrides provided
    via the command line. Ensure that the merging process maintains the integrity
    of the configuration structure and adheres to the validation rules defined in
    the schema.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/config.py
  acceptance: The merging logic correctly combines default configurations with command-line
    overrides, resulting in a valid and complete configuration.
  estimated_effort: high
  step_id: e20838a2:3
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Update CLI to Utilize Configurable Workflows
  details: Modify the CLI commands to utilize the loaded and merged configuration
    settings. Ensure that the CLI behavior reflects the configurations specified by
    the user, whether from the default file or overridden via the command line.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: CLI commands execute according to the specified configurations, demonstrating
    that the configuration system is fully integrated.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: e20838a2:4
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Write Unit Tests for Configuration System
  details: Develop comprehensive unit tests to verify the functionality of the configuration
    loading, validation, merging, and CLI integration. Ensure that tests cover various
    scenarios, including valid configurations, invalid configurations, and command-line
    overrides.
  files:
  - tests/test_config.py
  - tests/test_cli.py
  acceptance: All unit tests pass, confirming that the configuration system works
    as intended and handles edge cases appropriately.
  estimated_effort: high
  step_id: e20838a2:5
  sub_spec_id: null
review_notes:
- The spec does not define the expected structure or fields of the configuration,
  which will block implementation of the Pydantic model and merging logic. Clarify
  the config schema before coding.
- Merging CLI overrides with nested YAML configs can be tricky, especially with complex
  or deeply nested structures. Plan for recursive merging and type coercion to avoid
  subtle bugs.
- Click's handling of CLI arguments does not natively support dynamic or arbitrary
  config keys; you may need to explicitly map CLI options to config fields or use
  a generic --set key=value pattern.
- PyYAML and Pydantic are both current and well-maintained, but ensure you use Pydantic's
  v2 YAML parsing features (e.g., model_validate) for best integration and error reporting.
