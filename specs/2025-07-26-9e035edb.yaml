    description: Used for running and measuring test coverage
  files_involved:
  - tests/test_caching.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Demonstrate a simple caching mechanism in a testable Python function.
  - Write unit tests to verify caching behavior (e.g., repeated calls do not recompute).
  - Ensure the caching example is self-contained and does not require external dependencies
    beyond the standard library and existing project dependencies.
  - Integrate the test into the existing test suite using pytest.
  non_functional:
  - Maintain code readability and simplicity for solo developer workflows.
  - Ensure tests are deterministic and do not rely on external state.
  - Follow existing code quality and linting standards (ruff, pre-commit hooks).
  - Provide clear error messages if caching fails.
  constraints:
  - Use only Python 3.12+ features.
  - Do not introduce new dependencies unless absolutely necessary; prefer functools.lru_cache
    from the standard library.
  - Place new test files in the tests/ directory.
  - Maintain compatibility with Windows (CRLF/LF handling).
  - 'Follow project coding standards: type hints, dataclasses if needed, pathlib.Path
    for file operations, and comprehensive error handling.'
  - Write unit tests for all new functionality.
implementation:
- task: Implement a simple cache-enabled function.
  details: Create a Python function that simulates an expensive computation (e.g.,
    incrementing a counter or sleeping) and decorate it with functools.lru_cache.
    Ensure the function is type hinted and includes a docstring explaining its purpose.
  files:
  - tests/test_caching.py
  acceptance: Function is present, uses lru_cache, and is type hinted. Docstring explains
    caching behavior.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: 9e035edb:0
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Write unit tests to verify caching behavior.
  details: Write pytest-based tests that call the cache-enabled function multiple
    times with the same and different arguments. Assert that repeated calls with the
    same arguments do not recompute (e.g., by tracking a call counter or using mock).
    Ensure tests are clear and isolated.
  files:
  - tests/test_caching.py
  acceptance: Tests pass, clearly demonstrate caching, and are lint-compliant.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: 9e035edb:1
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Integrate with existing test suite and ensure code quality.
  details: Run make lint and make test to verify code quality and test coverage. Ensure
    no new lint errors are introduced and that the test is picked up by pytest-cov.
  files:
  - tests/test_caching.py
  acceptance: No new lint errors; test is executed and covered in test report.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: 9e035edb:2
  sub_spec_id: null
review_notes:
- "The spec omits how to track or assert the number of function calls in the test\u2014\
  explicitly recommend using a local counter or mock to verify caching, as lru_cache\
  \ does not expose this directly."
- Ensure the lru_cache usage specifies a reasonable maxsize (e.g., 128 or None) and
  document why, since the default may not be optimal for all use cases.
- pytest-cov 6.2.1 is not the latest version; check if upgrading is feasible to benefit
  from recent bug fixes and Python 3.12 compatibility improvements.
- No integration points or conflicts are described, but if the project uses custom
  pytest plugins or test discovery patterns, confirm that tests/test_caching.py will
  be picked up and not ignored.
