context:

  dependencies:
  - name: pyyaml

    description: Core dependency for YAML parsing and serialization
  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/specs/
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - tests/test_core.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Identify completed specifications in the 'specs' directory.
  - Publish completed specifications to a designated output location.
  - Remove unused, outdated, or test specifications from the 'specs' directory.
  - Analyze specification status and implementation to determine retention, publication,
    or removal.
  non_functional:
  - Ensure the cleanup process is efficient and does not disrupt ongoing development.
  - Provide informative logs detailing actions taken during the cleanup process.
  - Implement error handling to manage issues encountered during the cleanup.
  constraints:
  - Maintain compatibility with Python 3.12+.
  - Adhere to existing coding standards, including the use of Pydantic models and
    async/await for AI API calls.
  - Ensure Windows compatibility, particularly regarding CRLF/LF line endings.
  - Avoid introducing new dependencies unless absolutely necessary.
implementation:
- task: Develop a function to identify completed specifications in the 'specs' directory.
  details: 'Create a function that scans the ''specs'' directory, identifies YAML
    files, and determines their completion status based on predefined criteria (e.g.,
    presence of a ''status: completed'' field).'
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: The function accurately identifies and returns a list of completed specifications.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 0c415583:0
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Implement a mechanism to publish completed specifications to a designated
    output location.
  details: Develop functionality that takes the list of completed specifications and
    moves them to a specified output directory, ensuring that the move operation is
    atomic to prevent data loss.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Completed specifications are successfully moved to the output directory
    without data loss.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 0c415583:1
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Create a function to remove unused, outdated, or test specifications from
    the 'specs' directory.
  details: Develop a function that identifies specifications marked as unused, outdated,
    or for testing purposes (e.g., based on specific metadata fields) and removes
    them from the directory.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Specified specifications are accurately identified and removed from
    the 'specs' directory.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 0c415583:2
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Integrate the cleanup functions into the CLI tool.
  details: Add a new command to the CLI that triggers the cleanup process, providing
    options for dry-run mode and specifying the output directory for published specifications.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: The CLI command executes the cleanup process as expected, with appropriate
    options and informative output.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: 0c415583:3
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Implement comprehensive logging for the cleanup process.
  details: Ensure that all actions taken during the cleanup process are logged, including
    files identified, moved, or removed, and any errors encountered.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Logs provide clear and detailed information about the cleanup process.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: 0c415583:4
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Develop unit tests for the new cleanup functionalities.
  details: Write unit tests to verify the correctness of the functions for identifying,
    publishing, and removing specifications, including edge cases and error handling.
  files:
  - tests/test_core.py
  acceptance: All unit tests pass, demonstrating the reliability of the cleanup functionalities.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 0c415583:5
  sub_spec_id: null
review_notes:
- "Clarify the definition of 'completed' and 'unused/outdated/test' specifications\u2014\
  explicitly document the required YAML fields and values to avoid ambiguity during\
  \ implementation."
- For atomic file moves (especially on Windows), use Python's built-in 'os.replace'
  or 'shutil.move' and consider potential issues with cross-filesystem moves; test
  thoroughly for edge cases like locked files.
- Ensure the CLI dry-run mode does not perform any destructive actions and provides
  a clear, detailed preview of what would be moved or deleted, including file paths
  and reasons.
- Leverage Python's built-in 'logging' module for structured logs, and avoid print
  statements; provide log level options (e.g., info, debug) via CLI flags for better
  usability.
