  domain: Python CLI tool for AI-powered specification generation
  dependencies: []
  files_involved:
  - webui/templates/base.html
requirements:
  functional:
  - Add a persistent top navigation bar to base.html with links to Home, Specs, Tasks,
    and About.
  - Refactor base.html to use semantic HTML5 elements for layout structure.
  - Ensure consistent header and footer sections across all pages inheriting from
    base.html.
  - Maintain compatibility with existing template inheritance and content blocks.
  non_functional:
  - Ensure the navigation bar and layout are visually consistent across major browsers.
  - Maintain human-readable, maintainable HTML structure.
  - Do not introduce external CSS/JS dependencies beyond what is already present.
  constraints:
  - Only modify webui/templates/base.html.
  - Do not break existing template inheritance or block structure.
  - Use semantic HTML5 elements (e.g., <header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer>).
  - Ensure all navigation links use Jinja2 url_for or equivalent template syntax.
implementation:
- task: Analyze current base.html structure and identify existing layout and block
    usage.
  details: Review the current base.html template to document its block structure,
    layout elements, and any existing navigation or header/footer sections. Identify
    areas that require refactoring for semantic HTML5 compliance and persistent navigation.
  files:
  - webui/templates/base.html
  acceptance: A summary of current base.html structure and block usage is documented;
    areas for refactor are clearly identified.

- task: Implement persistent top navigation bar with required links.
  details: Add a <nav> element at the top of base.html containing links to Home, Specs,
    Tasks, and About. Use Jinja2 template syntax for URL generation. Ensure navigation
    bar is styled consistently with existing design (reuse classes/styles if present).
  files:
  - webui/templates/base.html
  acceptance: Navigation bar appears at the top of all pages inheriting from base.html,
    with correct links and consistent styling.

- task: Refactor layout to use semantic HTML5 elements.
  details: Update base.html to use <header> for the navigation bar, <main> for page
    content, and <footer> for the footer section. Ensure all content blocks are placed
    within appropriate semantic elements. Preserve existing block names and inheritance
    structure.
  files:
  - webui/templates/base.html
  acceptance: base.html uses semantic HTML5 elements for layout; all content blocks
    are preserved and correctly placed.

- task: Ensure consistent header and footer across all pages.
  details: Standardize the header (including navigation) and footer sections in base.html
    so that all child templates inherit a consistent look and structure. Move any
    duplicated header/footer code from child templates into base.html if necessary.
  files:
  - webui/templates/base.html
  acceptance: All pages inheriting from base.html display a consistent header and
    footer; no duplicated layout code remains in child templates.

- task: Test and verify layout and navigation bar across all major browsers.
  details: Manually verify that the navigation bar and layout render correctly in
    Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. Check that all navigation links work and that the layout
    is visually consistent.
  files:
  - webui/templates/base.html
  acceptance: Navigation bar and layout are visually consistent and functional in
    all tested browsers; all links work as expected.

review_notes:
- Check for any inline or duplicated navigation/header/footer code in child templates
  that needs to be moved to base.html; missing this will cause inconsistent layouts.
- Verify that all navigation links use Jinja2's url_for syntax; hardcoded URLs are
  a common mistake and break maintainability.
- Ensure that existing block names and inheritance structure are preserved exactly;
  renaming or moving blocks can silently break child templates.
- Do not introduce new CSS or JS dependencies; reuse existing classes/styles to maintain
  visual consistency and avoid scope creep.
