requirements:
  functional:
  - Enhance AI context awareness to generate accurate specifications for CLI improvements.
  - Implement a configuration system tailored for solo developer workflows.
  - Refine the template system for improved usability and flexibility.
  - Strengthen error handling with graceful AI fallbacks.
  - Streamline the user experience for efficient specification engineering.
  non_functional:
  - Maintain compatibility with existing Python CLI architecture.
  - Ensure code readability and maintainability.
  - Adhere to modern Python best practices and standards.
  constraints:
  - Retain the current file-based storage in the 'specs/' directory.
  - Utilize up-to-date, stable versions of all dependencies.
implementation:
- task: Enhance AI Context Awareness
  details: Integrate additional context parameters into AI prompts to improve relevance.
    Implement a feedback loop where the AI's outputs are evaluated and adjusted based
    on accuracy.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: AI generates specifications accurately aligned with CLI improvements.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: f998adbd:0
  sub_spec_id: '07720502'
- task: Implement Configurable Workflows
  details: Develop a configuration system using PyYAML to allow solo developers to
    customize workflows. Provide default configurations with options for customization.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/config.yaml
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: Users can modify 'config.yaml' to adjust workflows without altering
    code.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: f998adbd:1
  sub_spec_id: e20838a2
- task: Refine Template System
  details: Enhance the template system to support modular templates and inheritance.
    Implement validation to ensure templates are correctly structured.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/templates/
  acceptance: Templates are modular, reusable, and validated for correctness.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: f998adbd:2
  sub_spec_id: 462eb499
- task: Strengthen Error Handling
  details: Implement comprehensive error handling using Python's 'logging' module.
    Ensure the system provides informative error messages and graceful fallbacks when
    AI operations fail.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: System logs errors appropriately and continues operation when possible.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: f998adbd:3
  sub_spec_id: ce072f34
- task: Streamline User Experience
  details: Redesign CLI commands using Typer to simplify interactions. Provide clear
    help messages and documentation for each command.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: Users can efficiently generate specifications with minimal commands.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: f998adbd:4
  sub_spec_id: 1d504bb6
- task: Code Quality and Testing
  details: Enforce code quality using Ruff and Black for linting and formatting. Develop
    unit tests with pytest to ensure functionality.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - tests/
  acceptance: Code passes all linting, formatting checks, and unit tests.

review_notes:
- "The feedback loop for AI output evaluation and adjustment is underspecified\u2014\
  define how feedback is collected, stored, and used to adjust prompts or outputs\
  \ (manual review, automated scoring, etc.)."
- "Template modularity and inheritance require a clear structure\u2014specify how\
  \ templates reference each other and how validation is performed (e.g., schema,\
  \ Pydantic models)."
- Integrating PyYAML for workflow configuration is straightforward, but ensure robust
  schema validation and error reporting for malformed configs to avoid runtime surprises.
- Typer is a solid choice for CLI, but if commands are being redesigned, provide migration
  notes or alias support for existing users to prevent breaking changes.
