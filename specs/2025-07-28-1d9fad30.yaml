context:
  project: agentic-spec
  domain: Python CLI tool for AI-powered specification generation
  dependencies:
  - name: pydantic
    version: null
  - name: pytest
  files_involved:
  - tests/
requirements:
  functional:
  - Unit tests must cover model instantiation and validation, including both valid
    and invalid data.
  - Unit tests must cover deep merge logic, including edge cases with conflicting
    types, nested structures, and missing/extra fields.
  - Tests must be isolated, reproducible, and not depend on external state.
  - All new and existing tests must pass with no regressions.
  non_functional:
  - Tests must be written using pytest.
  - Test coverage must include all major edge cases for model validation and deep
    merging.
  - Tests should be easy to understand and maintain.
  constraints:
  - No changes to production code outside of test-specific fixtures or mocks.
  - Tests must reside in the tests/ directory and follow existing naming conventions.
  - No external dependencies beyond those already listed (pydantic, pytest).
implementation:
- task: Audit existing tests for model validation and deep merge logic
  details: Review all tests in tests/ to identify current coverage for model instantiation,
    validation errors, and deep merge scenarios. Document any missing edge cases or
    insufficiently tested behaviors.
  files:
  - tests/
  acceptance: A written summary (e.g., in a comment or markdown file) of current coverage
    and identified gaps is produced. No regressions in existing tests.

- task: Design comprehensive test cases for model validation edge cases
  details: 'Enumerate and design test cases for model instantiation and validation,
    including: required/optional fields, type mismatches, extra/missing fields, nested
    model validation, and invalid enum values. Include both positive and negative
    cases.'
  files:
  - tests/
  acceptance: A list of test cases is documented (e.g., as pytest parameterizations
    or comments). All major edge cases are represented.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 1d9fad30:1
  decomposition_hint: atomic
- task: Implement unit tests for model validation edge cases
  details: Write pytest-based unit tests for each designed case. Use fixtures or factory
    functions to generate valid/invalid data. Ensure tests are isolated and reproducible.
  files:
  - tests/test_model_validation.py
  acceptance: All model validation edge cases are covered by passing tests. Tests
    are isolated and reproducible. No regressions in existing suite.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 1d9fad30:2
  decomposition_hint: atomic
- task: Design comprehensive test cases for deep merge edge cases
  details: 'Enumerate and design test cases for deep merge logic, including: conflicting
    types (e.g., int vs str), nested structures (dicts within dicts), missing fields
    in one or both sources, extra fields, and preservation of original data. Include
    both expected merges and failure scenarios.'
  files:
  - tests/
  acceptance: A list of deep merge test cases is documented (e.g., as pytest parameterizations
    or comments). All major edge cases are represented.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 1d9fad30:3
  decomposition_hint: atomic
- task: Implement unit tests for deep merge edge cases
  details: Write pytest-based unit tests for each deep merge scenario. Use representative
    data structures to simulate real-world usage. Ensure tests are isolated, reproducible,
    and assert both correct merges and proper error handling.
  files:
  - tests/test_deep_merge.py
  acceptance: All deep merge edge cases are covered by passing tests. Tests are isolated
    and reproducible. No regressions in existing suite.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 1d9fad30:4
  decomposition_hint: atomic
- task: Integrate new tests into CI and verify full suite passes
  details: Ensure all new and existing tests are executed in the project's CI pipeline.
    Fix any regressions or failures. Confirm that test coverage includes all specified
    edge cases.
  files:
  - tests/
  - .github/workflows/
  - pyproject.toml
  acceptance: CI pipeline passes with all tests. Coverage report confirms all edge
    cases are tested. No regressions.
