context:
  project: agentic-spec
  domain: Python CLI tool for AI-powered specification generation
  dependencies:
  - name: pydantic
    version: null
  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  - agentic_spec/utils/deep_merge.py
  - tests/test_deep_merge.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Provide a deep merge utility that recursively merges nested dictionaries, lists,
    and Pydantic model instances.
  - Correctly handle merging of required and optional fields in Pydantic models.
  - Support both list concatenation and replacement strategies, configurable per merge
    operation.
  - Gracefully handle type mismatches with clear error reporting or configurable conflict
    resolution.
  - Integrate deep merge logic into relevant model methods or expose as a utility
    function.
  - Document all supported edge cases and expected behaviors.
  non_functional:
  - Implementation must be performant for typical configuration sizes (≤1000 fields,
    ≤5 nesting levels).
  - Code must be type-annotated and linted (PEP8).
  - Unit tests must cover all documented edge cases and error conditions.
  - No external dependencies beyond Pydantic and standard library.
  constraints:
  - Must not mutate input objects; always return a new merged instance.
  - Must be compatible with Pydantic v1 and v2 models.
  - All new code must reside in agentic_spec/utils/deep_merge.py except for integration
    points and tests.
implementation:
- task: Design deep merge algorithm for nested dicts, lists, and Pydantic models
  details: 'Specify recursive merge rules for dicts (key-wise merge), lists (configurable:
    concatenate or replace), and Pydantic models (field-wise merge, preserving required/optional
    semantics). Define handling for type mismatches (raise error or skip, based on
    config). Document all edge cases (e.g., merging None with value, conflicting types,
    merging lists of models).'
  files:
  - agentic_spec/utils/deep_merge.py
  acceptance: Algorithm design is documented in code comments and/or docstrings, covering
    all edge cases and configuration options.

- task: Implement deep merge utility function
  details: Implement a pure function (e.g., deep_merge(a, b, *, list_strategy='concat'|'replace',
    on_type_mismatch='error'|'skip')) that applies the designed algorithm. Ensure
    immutability of inputs. Support merging of Pydantic models, dicts, lists, and
    primitives. Include type annotations and docstrings.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/utils/deep_merge.py
  acceptance: Function passes all unit tests for documented behaviors and edge cases.
    Inputs are not mutated.

- task: Integrate deep merge utility into relevant model methods
  details: Identify where in agentic_spec/models.py deep merge is required (e.g.,
    model update/merge methods). Refactor or add methods to use the new utility, ensuring
    correct handling of required/optional fields and preserving model validation.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  acceptance: Integration points use the utility function; model methods behave as
    expected and pass all relevant tests.

  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: requires coordination between utility and model
    layer, and may affect multiple methods'

  approvals: null
- task: Write comprehensive unit tests for deep merge utility
  details: 'Create tests covering all documented edge cases: nested dicts, lists (concat/replace),
    Pydantic models with required/optional fields, type mismatches, None handling,
    and immutability. Use pytest or unittest. Place tests in a dedicated file.'
  files:
  - tests/test_deep_merge.py
  acceptance: All tests pass; coverage includes all edge cases and error conditions.

- task: Document deep merge utility usage and edge cases
  details: Add docstrings to the utility function and integration points. Provide
    usage examples and enumerate supported edge cases and configuration options. Ensure
    documentation is clear for solo developer use.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/utils/deep_merge.py
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  acceptance: Documentation is present, clear, and covers all behaviors and options.
