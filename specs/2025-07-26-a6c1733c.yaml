review_notes:
- Consider using Ruff exclusively for both linting and formatting, as it offers significant
  performance improvements over Black and is compatible with its style guide. ([astral.sh](https://astral.sh/blog/the-ruff-formatter?utm_source=openai))
- Ensure that Ruff is properly configured in your `pyproject.toml` file to align with
  your project's coding standards and to avoid conflicts between linting and formatting
  rules. ([gpxz.io](https://www.gpxz.io/blog/ruff?utm_source=openai))
- Implement a `Makefile` or similar automation to separate formatting (`ruff format`)
  and linting (`ruff check`) tasks, facilitating clear workflows and integration with
  CI/CD pipelines. ([gpxz.io](https://www.gpxz.io/blog/ruff?utm_source=openai))
- Regularly update Ruff to benefit from the latest features and improvements, and
  pin its version in your dependencies to maintain consistency across development
  environments. ([gpxz.io](https://www.gpxz.io/blog/ruff?utm_source=openai))
