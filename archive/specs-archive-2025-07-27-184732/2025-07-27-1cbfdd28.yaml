context:
  project: agentic-spec
  domain: Python CLI tool for AI-powered specification generation and task tracking
  dependencies:
  - name: pydantic
    description: For data validation and modeling
  - name: pyyaml
    description: For YAML-based storage
  - name: typer
    description: For CLI interface
  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  - agentic_spec/db.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Track task status (e.g., pending, in_progress, completed, approved, rejected)
  - Record timestamps for task creation, status changes, completion, and approval
  - Store completion notes and approval metadata (approver, timestamp, comments)
  - 'Enforce strict mode: block progression to next task until current task is approved'
  - Support override mechanism to bypass strict mode with explicit logging
  - Enable multiple approval levels (e.g., reviewer, lead) with metadata tracking
  non_functional:
  - Ensure all tracking data is persisted in human-readable YAML format
  - Provide comprehensive error handling and informative messages for workflow violations
  - Maintain compatibility with solo developer workflows and minimal setup
  - Support Windows and cross-platform file handling
  constraints:
  - Do not introduce external databases; use file-based storage only
  - Follow existing codebase structure and coding standards
  - Use Pydantic models for all new data structures
  - Implement unit tests for all new functionality
  - Maintain lint compliance with ruff and pre-commit hooks
implementation:
- task: Define task progress and approval models
  details: Create or extend Pydantic models to represent task status, timestamps,
    completion notes, and approval metadata. Include support for multiple approval
    levels and override tracking.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  acceptance: Models support all required fields and validation; unit tests cover
    all model behaviors and edge cases.

  decomposition_hint: 'composite: May be split into base task model, approval model,
    and override tracking model.'
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Implement file-based persistence for task tracking
  details: Extend or create functions to read/write task progress and approval data
    in YAML format. Ensure atomic updates and cross-platform compatibility.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/db.py
  acceptance: All task tracking data is reliably persisted and loaded from YAML files;
    error handling for file I/O is robust; unit tests verify persistence and recovery.

- task: Integrate progress tracking and approval workflow logic
  details: 'Implement core logic to update task status, record timestamps, handle
    completion notes, and manage approval metadata. Enforce strict mode: prevent progression
    to next task until approval is granted. Implement override mechanism with explicit
    logging.'
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Workflow enforces strict mode correctly; override is logged and auditable;
    all status transitions are validated; unit tests cover normal and edge cases.

  sub_spec_id: a00e8d61
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: Can be split into status update logic, strict mode
    enforcement, and override handling.'
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Support multiple approval levels in workflow
  details: Extend approval logic to require and track multiple approval levels (e.g.,
    reviewer, lead). Ensure metadata for each approval is stored and validated.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  acceptance: Multiple approval levels are enforced and tracked; metadata is complete
    and validated; unit tests cover multi-level approval scenarios.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 1cbfdd28:3
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: atomic
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: CLI integration for task progress and approval actions
  details: Add or extend CLI commands to update task status, add completion notes,
    approve/reject tasks, and perform overrides. Provide clear error messages and
    feedback.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: CLI exposes all required actions; error messages are informative; manual
    tests confirm end-to-end workflow.

  decomposition_hint: 'composite: Can be split into CLI command additions and user

  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Unit tests for progress tracking and approval workflow
  details: Write comprehensive unit tests for all new models, persistence logic, workflow
    enforcement, and CLI actions. Cover normal, edge, and error cases.
  files:
  - tests/test_models.py
  - tests/test_db.py
  - tests/test_core.py
  acceptance: All new functionality is covered by passing unit tests; edge cases and
    error handling are verified.

review_notes:
- Pydantic v2 introduced breaking changes; confirm you are using v2 syntax (e.g.,
  'model_validate', 'model_dump') and not v1 patterns.
- "Atomic YAML file updates are non-trivial\u2014use a temp file and atomic rename\
  \ to avoid data loss or corruption, especially on Windows."
- Multi-level approval logic can get complex; clearly separate approval state per
  level in your models to avoid ambiguous status or metadata.
- Typer CLI error handling should use Typer's exception system for user-friendly messages;
  avoid bare print statements for errors.
