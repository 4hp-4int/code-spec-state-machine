requirements:
  functional:
  - Migrate all existing YAML specifications in specs/ to the database using AsyncSpecManager
    and SQLiteBackend.
  - Preserve all metadata, context, and implementation details from YAML files during
    migration.
  - Add database tracking fields for specifications, including completion and workflow
    status.
  - Enable database querying and reporting for both migrated and new specifications.
  - Support both one-time bulk migration and incremental updates for new/changed YAML
    files.
  - Validate data integrity before, during, and after migration; abort and rollback
    on failure.
  - 'Maintain full backward compatibility: YAML files remain the source of truth and
    are not deleted.'
  - Create migration scripts and CLI commands for future schema changes and data migrations.
  non_functional:
  - Ensure atomic migration operations with rollback capability on error.
  - Optimize database with indexes for common query patterns (e.g., by status, completion,
    date).
  - Document the migration and recovery process for solo developer workflows.
  - Maintain comprehensive error handling and informative logging throughout migration.
  - Ensure migration is idempotent and safe to re-run.
  constraints:
  - Use only Python 3.12+ features and existing dependencies.
  - Do not introduce new dependencies unless absolutely necessary.
  - All file operations must use pathlib.Path.
  - All data structures must use Pydantic v2 models.
  - Follow established codebase structure and coding standards.
  - CLI interface must be maintained for automation and scripting.
  - Migration must be compatible with Windows (CRLF/LF handling).
implementation:
- task: Design migration plan and data mapping
  details: Analyze YAML specification schema and map all fields to the database models.
    Identify any gaps or mismatches between YAML and database schema. Define migration
    logic for metadata, context, implementation details, and workflow status. Document
    mapping and edge cases.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - specs/
  acceptance: Comprehensive mapping document produced; all YAML fields accounted for
    in database schema; edge cases identified.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 3d9915ba:0
  sub_spec_id: f48b0377
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: Requires analysis of both YAML and DB schema, and
    documentation of mapping logic.'
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Implement migration engine for bulk and incremental migration
  details: Develop migration logic in core.py to read all YAML files, validate against
    Pydantic models, and insert/update records in the database using AsyncSpecManager.
    Support both full migration (all files) and incremental (only new/changed files).
    Ensure atomicity and rollback on error.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  - specs/
  acceptance: All YAML specs migrated to database with full fidelity; migration can
    be run multiple times safely; rollback works on error.

  step_id: 3d9915ba:1
  sub_spec_id: a14041e9
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: Involves file I/O, data validation, async DB operations,
    and error handling.'
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Add database tracking fields and indexes
  details: Extend database schema (models.py) to include tracking fields for completion,
    workflow status, and timestamps. Add indexes for common queries (status, completion,
    date). Provide migration scripts for schema changes.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Database schema updated; indexes created; migration scripts available;
    no performance regressions.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 3d9915ba:2
  sub_spec_id: 21f7c2a9
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: Schema changes and index creation are distinct but
    related steps.'
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Implement CLI commands for migration and reporting
  details: Add CLI commands to trigger migration (bulk/incremental), show migration
    status, and generate reports on migrated data. Ensure commands are async and provide
    informative output/logging.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: CLI commands available and documented; migration and reporting can be
    triggered from CLI; output is clear and actionable.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 3d9915ba:3
  sub_spec_id: 28ab90f9
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: CLI command wiring and reporting logic can be developed/tested
    separately.'
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Validate data integrity and implement recovery procedures
  details: Develop validation routines to check data consistency between YAML files
    and database after migration. Implement recovery procedures for failed migrations,
    including rollback and manual intervention steps. Document all procedures.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - tests/
  - specs/
  acceptance: Validation routines catch all mismatches; recovery steps are documented
    and tested; migration is robust.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 3d9915ba:4
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: Validation and recovery are logically distinct but
    both ensure migration safety.'
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Write unit and integration tests for migration process
  details: Develop comprehensive tests covering migration logic, data integrity, rollback,
    and CLI commands. Use pytest and async test patterns. Mock file and DB operations
    as needed.
  files:
  - tests/
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: All migration code is covered by tests; tests pass for normal and error
    scenarios; code coverage is high.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 3d9915ba:5
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: Unit and integration tests can be developed independently.'
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Document migration process and developer guidance
  details: Write clear documentation for the migration process, including prerequisites,
    CLI usage, recovery steps, and troubleshooting. Target solo developer workflows
    and production-readiness.
  files:
  - README.md
  - docs/
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Documentation is complete, accurate, and easy to follow; covers all
    migration and recovery scenarios.

review_notes:
- "Missing Implementation Details: The spec assumes AsyncSpecManager and SQLiteBackend\
  \ are already implemented and compatible with async operations and Pydantic v2 models\u2014\
  verify their async support and Pydantic v2 compatibility before starting migration\
  \ logic."
- "Technical Gotchas: Handling both CRLF and LF line endings for cross-platform compatibility\
  \ can be tricky with YAML parsing\u2014test file reading on both Windows and Unix\
  \ to avoid subtle bugs."
- 'Integration Points: Ensure that the migration logic does not mutate or lock YAML
  files, as they remain the source of truth; all updates must be reflected only in
  the database, and any rollback must not affect the YAML files.'
- "Current Best Practices: Pydantic v2 has breaking changes from v1\u2014double-check\
  \ that all models and validation routines use the new syntax and features, especially\
  \ for custom validators and serialization."
