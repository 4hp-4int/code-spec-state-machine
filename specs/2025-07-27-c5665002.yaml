context:
  project: agentic-spec-foundation
  domain: Python CLI tool for AI-powered specification generation
  dependencies: []
  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Identify and list all CLI commands currently implemented in agentic_spec/cli.py.
  - 'Categorize each command into logical groupings: core (spec generation, validation),
    workflow (spec-complete, sync-foundation), template (template management), and
    database (commands interacting with persistent storage).'
  - Document the mapping of each command to its respective category.
  - Propose a module structure for reorganizing commands based on these categories.
  non_functional:
  - Ensure the categorization is comprehensive and unambiguous.
  - Maintain clear documentation for future maintainability.
  constraints:
  - Do not modify any command implementations at this stage.
  - Do not introduce new command categories beyond those specified unless an existing
    command does not fit any provided category.
  - All analysis and documentation must be based strictly on the current state of
    agentic_spec/cli.py.
implementation:
- task: Extract and list all CLI commands from agentic_spec/cli.py.
  details: Review the source code in agentic_spec/cli.py and enumerate every CLI command,
    capturing their names and brief descriptions.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: A complete list of all CLI commands present in cli.py, each with its
    name and a one-line description.

- task: Categorize each CLI command into core, workflow, template, or database groups.
  details: For each command identified, assign it to one of the specified categories
    based on its primary function. If a command does not fit any category, flag it
    for review.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: Each command is assigned to a category, with a rationale for any commands
    that do not fit the provided categories.

- task: Document the mapping of commands to categories and propose a new module structure.
  details: Create a mapping table or list showing each command and its assigned category.
    Based on this mapping, outline a proposed module structure (e.g., core.py, workflow.py,
    template.py, database.py) for future code organization.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: A clear document or table mapping commands to categories, plus a proposed
    file/module structure for reorganizing the CLI commands.

review_notes:
- 'Missing Implementation Details: The spec assumes all CLI commands are easily identifiable
  and self-describing in cli.py, but does not specify how to handle nested or dynamically
  registered commands (e.g., via decorators or plugin patterns). Clarify how to extract
  commands if they are not statically defined.'
- 'Technical Gotchas: If using a CLI framework like Click or Typer, commands may be
  grouped or registered in non-obvious ways. Be prepared to parse decorators or command
  groups, not just function names.'
- 'Integration Points: The proposed module structure (core.py, workflow.py, etc.)
  may conflict with existing imports or shared utilities in cli.py. Plan for refactoring
  imports and shared logic when reorganizing.'
- 'Current Best Practices: Ensure the CLI framework in use (e.g., Click, Typer, argparse)
  is up-to-date and well-maintained. If not, consider upgrading before further modularization.'
