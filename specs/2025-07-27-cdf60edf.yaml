  status: draft

context:
  project: agentic-spec-foundation
  domain: Python CLI tool for AI-powered specification generation
  dependencies:
  - name: pytest-cov
    version: 6.2.1
    description: 'Core dependency: test coverage for Python'
  files_involved:
  - tests/test_auto_save.py
  - agentic_spec/core.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Verify that the auto-save functionality correctly persists data to a YAML file
    when triggered.
  - Ensure that the saved file is human-readable and matches the expected data structure.
  - Test should simulate a typical save operation without requiring external database
    dependencies.
  non_functional:
  - Test must be idempotent and not leave residual files after execution.
  - Test must run successfully on Windows and Unix-like systems (CRLF/LF compatibility).
  - Test must provide clear error messages on failure.
  constraints:
  - Use only file-based storage (YAML) as per project requirements.
  - Do not introduce new dependencies beyond those already present.
  - Follow existing codebase structure and naming conventions.
  - Implement tests using pytest and Python 3.12+ features.
  - Maintain lint compliance with ruff and pre-commit hooks.
implementation:
- task: Create a unit test for auto-save functionality
  details: Implement a pytest function that triggers the auto-save logic in agentic_spec/core.py,
    writes a sample data structure to a temporary YAML file, and verifies the file
    contents match the expected output. Use Python's tempfile and pathlib for file
    handling. Clean up any files created during the test.
  files:
  - tests/test_auto_save.py
  acceptance: Test passes, correctly verifies YAML output, and leaves no residual
    files. Lint and pre-commit checks pass.

- task: Ensure auto-save logic is accessible and testable
  details: Review agentic_spec/core.py to confirm that the auto-save function is modular
    and can be invoked independently for testing. Refactor if necessary to allow injection
    of file paths and data for testability, without changing core logic.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Auto-save function can be called with test data and file path. No breaking
    changes to existing functionality.

review_notes:
- "Check that the auto-save function in agentic_spec/core.py allows injection of both\
  \ data and file path\u2014if not, refactor for testability without altering core\
  \ logic."
- Use tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile with delete=False and pathlib.Path for cross-platform
  file handling; ensure explicit cleanup in the test to avoid residual files.
- Verify that the YAML serialization uses safe_dump (from PyYAML) and enforces human-readable
  formatting (indentation, no flow style); confirm PyYAML is present and up-to-date.
- Linting with ruff and pre-commit should be run locally before PR; ensure test file
  and any refactor maintain code style and naming conventions.
