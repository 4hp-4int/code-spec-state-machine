  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Allow the AI to inject new tasks into the workflow during execution when scope
    gaps are detected.
  - Dynamically update the in-memory workflow graph to reflect injected tasks.
  - Persist injected tasks and updated workflow structure to the YAML spec files.
  - Assign unique IDs and maintain parent-child relationships for all injected tasks.
  - Provide immediate CLI feedback to the user when a task is injected.
  - Ensure injected tasks are visible in both the YAML spec and the workflow graph.
  non_functional:
  - Task injection must not introduce race conditions or corrupt the workflow state.
  - CLI feedback must be clear, concise, and actionable.
  - Updates to YAML files must be atomic to prevent data loss.
  - System must handle injection latency gracefully (no CLI blocking).
  - Injected tasks must be traceable for audit/debugging purposes.
  constraints:
  - All changes must be compatible with existing workflow and graph models.
  - No breaking changes to the CLI or YAML schema.
  - Maintain compatibility with Python 3.9+.
  - Follow existing code style and architecture.
implementation:
- task: Extend workflow graph model to support dynamic task injection and parent-child
    tracking.
  details: Update the workflow graph data structure in agentic_spec/core.py and agentic_spec/models.py
    to allow insertion of new tasks at runtime. Ensure each task node has a unique
    ID and references to parent/child nodes. Add metadata fields to distinguish injected
    tasks.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  acceptance: Graph can accept new tasks at runtime, each with unique ID and correct
    parent-child links. Injected tasks are distinguishable in the graph structure.

  sub_spec_id: 26977a84
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: involves both data model changes and runtime graph
    mutation logic'
- task: Implement in-memory workflow graph update logic for task injection.
  details: Add functions to agentic_spec/core.py to inject new tasks into the active
    workflow graph. Ensure atomicity of updates and maintain graph consistency. Handle
    edge cases such as duplicate IDs, circular dependencies, and invalid parent references.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: New tasks can be injected without breaking the workflow graph. All edge
    cases are handled gracefully.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 0a5fd786:1
  sub_spec_id: ae5b46f8
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: requires coordination between graph mutation and
    validation logic'
- task: Persist injected tasks and updated workflow to YAML spec files.
  details: Modify YAML serialization/deserialization logic in agentic_spec/core.py
    to support saving and loading injected tasks. Ensure atomic file writes and schema
    compatibility. Add versioning or metadata to track injected tasks.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Injected tasks are saved to and loaded from YAML files without data
    loss or schema errors. File writes are atomic.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 0a5fd786:2
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: involves both serialization logic and file I/O safety'
- task: Update CLI to provide real-time feedback on task injection events.
  details: Enhance agentic_spec/cli.py to display clear notifications when tasks are
    injected. Include task ID, summary, and parent relationship in the output. Ensure
    CLI remains responsive during injection.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: User receives immediate, informative CLI feedback whenever a task is
    injected.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: 0a5fd786:3
  decomposition_hint: atomic
- task: Integrate AI-driven scope gap detection and task proposal mechanism.
  details: Implement or extend logic in agentic_spec/core.py to allow the AI to propose
    new tasks when gaps are detected. Ensure proposals are validated before injection
    and that rejected proposals are logged for audit.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: AI can propose tasks, which are validated and injected if appropriate.
    Invalid proposals are logged.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 0a5fd786:4
  sub_spec_id: 04361c3d
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: requires integration between AI, validation, and
    injection subsystems'
- task: Add and update tests for dynamic task injection, graph updates, YAML persistence,
    and CLI feedback.
  details: Write unit and integration tests covering task injection, graph integrity,
    YAML file updates, and CLI output. Include tests for edge cases (e.g., duplicate
    IDs, invalid parents, file write failures).
  files:
  - tests/test_core.py
  - tests/test_cli.py
  acceptance: All new and existing tests pass. Coverage includes all new logic and
    edge cases.
