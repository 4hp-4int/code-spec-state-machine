  version: '1.0'
  status: implemented
  parent_spec_id: null
  child_spec_ids: null
context:
  project: agentic-spec
  domain: Python CLI tool for specification generation
  dependencies:
  - name: PyYAML
    version: 6.0.1
    purpose: Parsing and writing YAML files
  - name: NetworkX
    version: '3.3'
    purpose: Managing and analyzing graph relationships between specifications
  - name: Matplotlib
    version: 3.9.2
    purpose: Visualizing graph relationships
  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/graph_visualization.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Enable hierarchical sub-specifications where implementation steps can generate
    detailed child specifications.
  - Establish and manage parent-child relationships between specifications to form
    a graph-like structure.
  - Implement CLI commands to visualize specification relationships and expand implementation
    steps into sub-specifications.
  - Ensure the system supports a complete spec-driven development workflow, including
    using specifications to guide the development of the project itself.
  non_functional:
  - Maintain compatibility with existing Python CLI architecture.
  - Ensure the system is scalable to handle complex and large specification graphs.
  - Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for new features.
  constraints:
  - Preserve existing functionalities and backward compatibility.
  - Utilize current, stable versions of libraries and frameworks.
  - Adhere to best practices for Python CLI development and graph visualization.
implementation:
- task: Extend models.py to support hierarchical relationships
  details: Modify the Specification class to include parent and child relationships,
    enabling the creation of a graph structure among specifications.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  acceptance: Specifications can reference parent and child specifications, forming
    a navigable hierarchy.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: null
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Enhance core.py for recursive sub-specification generation
  details: Update the core logic to allow implementation steps to generate detailed
    child specifications recursively, supporting complex task breakdowns.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Implementation steps can spawn child specifications, and the system
    can handle recursive generation without errors.
  estimated_effort: high
  step_id: null
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Implement CLI command 'agentic-spec graph' for visualization
  details: Develop a new CLI command that utilizes NetworkX and Matplotlib to visualize
    the relationships between specifications as a graph.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/graph_visualization.py
  acceptance: Running 'agentic-spec graph' displays a visual representation of specification
    relationships.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: null
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Implement CLI command 'agentic-spec expand task-id' to generate sub-specifications
  details: Add a CLI command that, given a task ID, generates a detailed sub-specification
    for that task and integrates it into the existing hierarchy.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Running 'agentic-spec expand task-id' creates a sub-specification linked
    to the specified task.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: null
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Update documentation to reflect new features
  details: Revise existing documentation and add new sections to cover hierarchical
    sub-specifications, graph visualization, and new CLI commands.
  files:
  - docs/user_guide.md
  - docs/api_reference.md
  acceptance: Documentation accurately describes new features with examples and usage
    instructions.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: null
  sub_spec_id: null
review_notes:
- "Clarify how parent/child relationships are persisted and loaded\u2014if specifications\
  \ are YAML files, define the schema changes and migration strategy to avoid breaking\
  \ existing specs."
- Recursive sub-spec generation in core.py risks stack overflows or infinite loops
  if cycles exist; implement cycle detection and recursion limits.
- For the 'agentic-spec graph' CLI, specify how specs are discovered (directory scan?
  config file?) and ensure graph_visualization.py cleanly separates graph construction
  from rendering for testability.
- "Consider breaking down recursive sub-spec generation into smaller, testable units\u2014\
  full recursion and integration with CLI in one step is high risk for a solo dev."
