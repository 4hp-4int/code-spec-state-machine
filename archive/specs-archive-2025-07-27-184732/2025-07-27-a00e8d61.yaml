context:
  project: agentic-spec
  domain: Python CLI tool for AI-powered specification generation and task tracking
  dependencies: []
  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Track and update task status with timestamps for each status change.
  - Record completion notes and associate them with the relevant task.
  - Store and manage approval metadata, including approver identity, approval timestamp,
    and any comments.
  - 'Enforce strict mode: prevent progression to the next task until current task
    is approved.'
  - Implement an override mechanism that allows bypassing approval with explicit logging
    of the override event.
  non_functional:
  - Ensure all progress and approval actions are logged with sufficient detail for
    auditability.
  - Provide clear and informative error messages for all workflow violations (e.g.,
    attempting to progress without approval in strict mode).
  - Maintain compatibility with existing file-based storage and data models.
  constraints:
  - All logic must reside in agentic_spec/core.py.
  - 'Follow established coding standards: use dataclasses/Pydantic for data, async/await
    where appropriate, and comprehensive error handling.'
  - No new dependencies may be introduced.
  - Implementation must be covered by unit tests (to be specified separately).
implementation:
- task: Extend task data model to support progress tracking and approval metadata
  details: Add fields for status, status change timestamps, completion notes, approval
    metadata (approver, approval timestamp, comments), and override flag to the task
    data structure. Ensure compatibility with existing YAML serialization.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Task model supports all required fields and can be serialized/deserialized
    without data loss.

  decomposition_hint: composite:may require changes to both data model and serialization
    logic
  progress: null

- task: Implement core logic to update task status and record timestamps
  details: Create functions/methods to update task status, automatically record the
    timestamp of each status change, and validate allowed status transitions.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Status changes update both the status and the corresponding timestamp;
    invalid transitions raise informative errors.

  decomposition_hint: atomic
  progress: null

- task: Add support for recording and storing completion notes
  details: Implement logic to attach completion notes to a task upon marking it as
    complete. Ensure notes are persisted and retrievable.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Completion notes are correctly stored and associated with the completed
    task.

- task: Implement approval workflow logic and metadata management
  details: Add functions to record approval actions, including approver identity,
    approval timestamp, and optional comments. Ensure approval status is reflected
    in the task metadata.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Approval actions update task metadata and are logged for auditability.

  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: atomic
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: 'Enforce strict mode: prevent progression to next task until approval is granted'
  details: Implement logic to block status progression (e.g., from 'in_review' to
    'done') unless the task is explicitly approved when strict mode is enabled. Provide
    clear error messages if progression is attempted prematurely.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Progression is blocked in strict mode until approval; violations raise
    clear errors.

- task: Implement override mechanism with explicit logging
  details: Allow authorized users to override the approval requirement, forcing progression
    to the next task. Log all override events with user identity, timestamp, and reason
    for audit purposes.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Overrides are possible, logged with all required metadata, and clearly
    marked in task history.

review_notes:
- 'Missing Implementation Details: The spec does not specify the allowed status values
  or valid status transitions, which are critical for implementing status validation
  and error handling. Define these explicitly before coding.'
- 'Technical Gotchas: YAML serialization/deserialization of nested or complex metadata
  (e.g., approval history, override logs) can be tricky with dataclasses or Pydantic.
  Test round-trip serialization early to avoid silent data loss or schema drift.'
- 'Integration Points: If the existing codebase uses plain dataclasses, introducing
  Pydantic models (or vice versa) could cause subtle incompatibilities, especially
  with custom serialization logic. Stick to one approach for all models in core.py.'
- 'Current Best Practices: No new dependencies are allowed, so use the standard library''s
  datetime for timestamps and ensure all logging/audit trails are handled via structured
  data fields, not print/log statements.'
