requirements:
  functional:
  - Provide CLI command to trigger bulk migration of specifications.
  - Provide CLI command to trigger incremental migration of specifications.
  - Provide CLI command to display migration status.
  - Provide CLI command to generate and display reports on migrated data.
  - Ensure all CLI commands are implemented as async functions.
  - Output informative messages and logs for all CLI operations.
  non_functional:
  - Maintain comprehensive error handling with clear, actionable messages.
  - Ensure CLI commands are responsive and do not block the main thread.
  - Support solo developer workflows with minimal configuration.
  - Maintain compatibility with Windows (CRLF/LF handling).
  constraints:
  - Do not introduce new dependencies outside the current set.
  - Follow established codebase structure and coding standards.
  - Use typer for CLI command definitions.
  - Implement unit tests for all new CLI commands.
  - Use pathlib.Path for all file operations.
  - Store all migration and report data in human-readable YAML format.
  - Do not use external databases.
implementation:
- task: Define async CLI command for bulk migration
  details: Implement a typer CLI command that triggers a bulk migration of all specifications.
    The command should call an async migration function in core.py, handle exceptions
    gracefully, and output progress and completion messages.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Running the CLI with the bulk migration command initiates migration,
    displays progress, and completes with a summary message. Errors are handled and
    reported clearly.

- task: Define async CLI command for incremental migration
  details: Add a typer CLI command to trigger incremental migration (e.g., only new
    or changed specifications). The command should invoke an async function in core.py,
    provide feedback on what is migrated, and handle errors.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: CLI incremental migration command migrates only new/changed specs, outputs
    informative status, and handles errors gracefully.

  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: atomic

- task: Implement async CLI command to show migration status
  details: Create a typer CLI command that displays the current status of migrations
    (e.g., pending, in-progress, completed). Fetch status from core.py and present
    it in a user-friendly format.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: CLI status command shows accurate, up-to-date migration status with
    clear formatting.

- task: Implement async CLI command to generate migration reports
  details: Add a typer CLI command to generate and display reports on migrated data
    (e.g., counts, errors, summaries). The report should be generated via core.py
    and output in YAML or table format.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: CLI report command outputs a readable summary of migration results,
    including counts and any errors, in YAML or table format.

- task: Add informative output and logging to all migration/reporting CLI commands
  details: Ensure all CLI commands provide clear, actionable feedback to the user,
    including progress, completion, and error messages. Use consistent formatting
    and logging practices.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: All CLI commands output progress, completion, and error messages in
    a consistent, user-friendly manner.

- task: Implement comprehensive error handling for migration/reporting commands
  details: Add robust error handling to all migration and reporting CLI commands.
    Ensure exceptions are caught, logged, and reported with actionable messages.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: All CLI commands handle errors gracefully, providing clear messages
    and not crashing the CLI.

- task: Write unit tests for all migration and reporting CLI commands
  details: Create unit tests covering normal operation, error cases, and edge cases
    for each CLI command. Use async test patterns and mocking as needed.
  files:
  - tests/test_cli.py
  acceptance: Tests cover all CLI commands, including success and failure scenarios,
    and pass with the current test suite.

review_notes:
- 'Missing Implementation Details: The spec does not clarify how migration state is
  tracked (e.g., which specs are new/changed, or migration status persistence). Define
  a YAML-based state file or in-memory structure in core.py to avoid ambiguity.'
- 'Technical Gotchas: Typer does not natively support async commands before v0.12.0,
  but your version is current. Ensure you use Typer''s async command support correctly,
  and test CLI responsiveness, especially on Windows.'
- 'Integration Points: If migration/report data is stored in YAML, ensure all file
  I/O uses pathlib.Path and handles CRLF/LF differences explicitly for Windows compatibility.
  Validate YAML output formatting for both human and machine readability.'
- 'Quick Wins: For progress and status reporting, consider using simple print statements
  or Typer''s echo for consistency, rather than introducing complex logging frameworks.
  This keeps the CLI lightweight and easy to maintain.'
