context:
  project: agentic-spec
  domain: Python CLI tool for AI-powered specification generation
  dependencies:
  - name: pydantic
    version: None@latest
  - name: pytest
    version: latest
  files_involved:
  - tests/
requirements:
  functional:
  - Systematically review all test files in the tests/ directory for model validation
    and deep merge logic.
  - Identify and document current test coverage for model instantiation, validation
    errors, and deep merge scenarios.
  - Detect and record any missing edge cases or insufficiently tested behaviors related
    to model validation and deep merge.
  - Produce a written summary of findings, including coverage and gaps, in a dedicated
    markdown or comment file.
  non_functional:
  - The audit process must not introduce regressions or modify existing test logic.
  - Documentation must be clear, actionable, and suitable for a solo developer to
    follow up.
  - The process should be repeatable and leave a clear audit trail for future contributors.
  constraints:
  - No changes to production code or test logic during the audit step.
  - All findings must be documented in a single, clearly named file (e.g., tests/TEST_AUDIT.md).
  - The audit must cover all files in tests/, including subdirectories if present.
implementation:
- task: Enumerate all test files and relevant test cases in tests/ directory
  details: List every test file and, within each, identify test functions/classes
    related to model validation and deep merge logic. Note any files or tests that
    appear unrelated or out of scope.
  files:
  - tests/
  acceptance: A complete inventory of test files and relevant test cases is created,
    either as a section in the audit summary or as a preparatory checklist.

  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: atomic
  progress: null

- task: Review test coverage for model instantiation and validation errors
  details: For each relevant test, determine which aspects of model instantiation
    and validation errors are covered (e.g., required fields, type errors, boundary
    values). Note any missing or weakly tested scenarios.
  files:
  - tests/
  acceptance: Coverage for model instantiation and validation errors is clearly described
    in the audit summary, with gaps or weaknesses explicitly listed.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: ac05c0aa:1
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: atomic
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Review test coverage for deep merge logic and edge cases
  details: Analyze tests for deep merge functionality, focusing on edge cases such
    as nested structures, conflicting keys, type mismatches, and empty/None values.
    Identify any untested or under-tested behaviors.
  files:
  - tests/
  acceptance: Coverage for deep merge logic and edge cases is documented in the audit
    summary, with specific gaps or missing cases highlighted.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: ac05c0aa:2
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: atomic
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Document findings and identified gaps in a summary file
  details: 'Consolidate the results of the audit into a markdown file (e.g., tests/TEST_AUDIT.md).
    The summary must include: (1) inventory of test files/cases, (2) coverage analysis
    for model validation and deep merge, (3) explicit list of missing or insufficiently
    tested cases, and (4) recommendations for future test improvements.'
  files:
  - tests/TEST_AUDIT.md
  acceptance: A well-structured markdown file exists in tests/ with all required sections
    and actionable findings. The file is clear and understandable to a solo developer.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: ac05c0aa:3
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: atomic
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Verify no regressions or unintended changes in existing tests
  details: Ensure that the audit process has not altered or removed any test logic
    or files. Optionally, rerun the test suite to confirm all tests still pass.
  files:
  - tests/
  acceptance: All tests pass as before; no changes to test logic or structure are
    detected.
