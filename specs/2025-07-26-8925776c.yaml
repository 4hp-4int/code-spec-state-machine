review_notes:
- Ensure the 'SemanticCache' class is designed to handle both local embeddings using
  the latest 'sentence-transformers' library (v5.0) and OpenAI embeddings, incorporating
  configurable similarity thresholds and efficient vector similarity search with numpy
  operations. ([sbert.net](https://sbert.net/?utm_source=openai))
- Implement a mechanism to select between local embeddings and OpenAI embeddings based
  on availability and performance, ensuring seamless fallback and optimal functionality.
- 'Break down the implementation into smaller, manageable tasks:'
- Consider using optimized backends like ONNX or OpenVINO to accelerate inference,
  especially for large-scale deployments, ensuring compatibility with the 'sentence-transformers'
  library. ([sbert.net](https://www.sbert.net/docs/sentence_transformer/usage/efficiency.html?utm_source=openai))
