  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/template_loader.py
  - templates/default_spec.yaml
  - templates/example_pattern.yaml
  - templates/README.md
requirements:
  functional:
  - Extend the 'init' CLI command to generate a set of default specification templates
    in the templates/ directory.
  - Include practical example templates that demonstrate common patterns and best
    practices for agentic-spec usage.
  - Ensure generated templates are immediately usable for new projects, enabling users
    to generate specs without additional setup.
  - Document the structure and usage of the default templates within a README.md placed
    in the templates/ directory.
  non_functional:
  - Maintain human-readable YAML format for all templates.
  - Ensure all generated files are lint-compliant and follow project coding standards.
  - Support both Windows and Unix line endings (CRLF/LF) in generated files.
  - Provide clear error messages if template generation fails or if files already
    exist.
  constraints:
  - Do not introduce new dependencies; use only those already present in the codebase.
  - Generated templates must not overwrite existing files unless explicitly confirmed
    by the user.
  - All file operations must use pathlib.Path for compatibility.
  - Follow configuration-driven behavior; avoid hard-coded values where possible.
  - Maintain compatibility with Python 3.12+.
implementation:
- task: Design a set of default specification templates and practical example patterns
    for new projects.
  details: Create YAML templates that illustrate common agentic-spec patterns, such
    as hierarchical specs, template inheritance, and context-aware prompting. Include
    at least one foundational spec, one example with parent-child relationships, and
    one demonstrating template inheritance.
  files:
  - templates/default_spec.yaml
  - templates/example_pattern.yaml
  acceptance: Templates are human-readable, lint-compliant, and demonstrate at least
    three distinct agentic-spec features. Templates are validated by the template_validator
    module.

  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: requires both template authoring and validation
    for multiple agentic-spec features'
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Update the 'init' CLI command to generate the default templates and supporting
    README.md in the templates/ directory.
  details: Modify agentic_spec/cli.py to copy or generate the default templates and
    a README.md into the templates/ directory when the init command is run. Ensure
    the command checks for existing files and prompts the user before overwriting.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - templates/default_spec.yaml
  - templates/example_pattern.yaml
  - templates/README.md
  acceptance: Running 'agentic-spec init' in a new directory creates the templates/
    directory with the default templates and README.md. If files exist, the user is
    prompted before overwrite. All file operations use pathlib.Path.

  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: involves CLI logic, file system operations, and
    user interaction'
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Document the structure and usage of the default templates in a README.md file
    within the templates/ directory.
  details: Write a concise README.md that explains the purpose of each template, how
    to use them, and how to extend them for new projects. Include references to agentic-spec
    best practices.
  files:
  - templates/README.md
  acceptance: README.md is present, clear, and provides actionable guidance for new
    users. It references all included templates and their intended use cases.

- task: Implement comprehensive error handling and user feedback for the init command
    template generation process.
  details: Ensure that all errors (e.g., permission issues, existing files, invalid
    template content) are caught and reported with informative messages. Follow the
    project's exception formatting standards.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: All error scenarios during template generation are handled gracefully,
    with clear and actionable error messages. No unhandled exceptions are raised.

  approvals: null
- task: Write unit tests for the enhanced init command covering template generation,
    file existence checks, user prompts, and error handling.
  details: Add tests to ensure the init command creates the correct files, handles
    existing files appropriately, and provides correct error messages. Use mocking
    for file operations and user input.
  files:
  - tests/test_cli.py
  acceptance: Tests cover all major code paths for the init command enhancements,
    including success, overwrite prompt, and error scenarios. All tests pass.
