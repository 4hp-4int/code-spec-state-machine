context:
  project: agentic-spec

  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/config.py
  - tests/test_config.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Provide a utility function to load the foundation context from a YAML file.
  - Ensure the function returns a Python dictionary representing the loaded context.
  - Handle file-not-found and YAML parsing errors gracefully with informative error
    messages.
  - Write unit tests to verify correct loading, error handling, and edge cases.
  non_functional:
  - Use pathlib.Path for all file operations.
  - Maintain comprehensive inline documentation and Google-style docstrings.
  - Ensure code is covered by unit tests using pytest.
  - Log errors using the established logging format and level.
  constraints:
  - Do not introduce new dependencies; use PyYAML for YAML parsing.
  - Follow PEP 8 and project coding standards.
  - Place the utility function in agentic_spec/config.py.
  - Store test cases in tests/test_config.py.
  - Support Python 3.12+ features and type hints.
implementation:
- task: Implement foundation context loading utility
  details: 'Create a function `load_foundation_context(path: Path) -> dict` in agentic_spec/config.py.
    The function should read a YAML file from the given path using pathlib.Path, parse
    it with PyYAML, and return the resulting dictionary. If the file does not exist
    or is invalid YAML, raise a custom exception with an informative message and log
    the error using the project''s logging configuration.'
  files:
  - agentic_spec/config.py
  acceptance: Function loads valid YAML as dict, raises and logs errors for missing
    or invalid files, and follows all coding standards.

- task: Write unit tests for context loading utility
  details: 'Add tests in tests/test_config.py to cover: successful loading of a valid
    YAML file, handling of missing file, and handling of invalid YAML. Use pytest
    and pytest-cov for coverage. Mock file paths and contents as needed to avoid filesystem
    dependencies.'
  files:
  - tests/test_config.py
  acceptance: Tests cover all code paths, pass with pytest, and achieve full coverage
    for the utility function.

review_notes:
- Ensure that the `load_foundation_context` function uses `safe_load` from PyYAML
  to prevent potential security risks associated with loading untrusted YAML content.
- Implement comprehensive logging within the `load_foundation_context` function to
  capture detailed error information, facilitating easier debugging and maintenance.
- In the unit tests, utilize `pytest`'s `tmp_path` fixture to create temporary files
  for testing, ensuring that tests are isolated and do not depend on external files.
- Verify that the project's logging configuration is properly set up to handle error
  messages generated by the `load_foundation_context` function, ensuring that logs
  are captured and stored as intended.
