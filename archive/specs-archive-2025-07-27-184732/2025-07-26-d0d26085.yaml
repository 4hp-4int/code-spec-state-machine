  - tests/test_command_execution.py
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  - agentic_spec/core.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Ensure all tests pass without errors or warnings.
  - Implement proper error handling in CLI commands.
  - Correctly mock asynchronous functions in tests.
  - Verify Typer integration in CLI commands.
  - Ensure command execution functions as expected.
  non_functional:
  - Maintain comprehensive error messages for CLI operations.
  - Ensure tests are reliable and do not produce intermittent failures.
  - Maintain code readability and adherence to coding standards.
  constraints:
  - Use Python 3.12+ features.
  - Follow existing coding standards and design patterns.
  - Avoid introducing new dependencies unless absolutely necessary.
implementation:
- task: Update pytest and related plugins to compatible versions.
  details: Ensure pytest and plugins like pytest-asyncio and pytest-mock are updated
    to versions compatible with Python 3.12 to avoid deprecation warnings and ensure
    smooth test execution.
  files:
  - requirements.txt
  acceptance: Running 'pytest' should not produce deprecation warnings related to
    pytest or its plugins.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: d0d26085:0
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Correct usage of async mocks in tests.
  details: Review and update tests to ensure asynchronous functions are properly awaited.
    Replace incorrect mock usage with appropriate async mocks to prevent 'coroutine
    was never awaited' warnings.
  files:
  - tests/test_async_operations.py
  acceptance: Tests should not produce warnings about unawaited coroutines.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: d0d26085:1
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Implement proper error handling in CLI commands.
  details: Enhance CLI commands to handle exceptions gracefully, providing informative
    error messages to the user. Ensure that Typer's exception handling mechanisms
    are utilized effectively.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: CLI commands should display user-friendly error messages upon encountering
    exceptions.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: d0d26085:2
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Verify and fix Typer integration issues.
  details: Ensure that Typer is correctly integrated with the CLI commands. Address
    any issues related to command parsing, argument handling, or command execution.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/cli.py
  acceptance: CLI commands should execute as expected without errors related to Typer
    integration.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: d0d26085:3
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Ensure command execution functions correctly.
  details: Review and test command execution paths to ensure they perform the intended
    actions without errors. Address any issues related to command logic or dependencies.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: Commands should execute their intended functions without errors.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: d0d26085:4
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Update and run the test suite to confirm all issues are resolved.
  details: After implementing the above fixes, update the test suite as necessary
    and run all tests to ensure that the previous failures and warnings are resolved.
  files:
  - tests/
  acceptance: All tests should pass without errors or warnings.
