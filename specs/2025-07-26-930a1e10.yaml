requirements:
  functional:
  - Resolve all 237 linting errors in the codebase without altering existing functionality.
  - Implement automated linting checks in the development workflow to prevent future
    linting issues.
  non_functional:
  - Maintain code readability and adherence to PEP 8 standards.
  - Ensure that all changes are covered by existing or new unit tests to verify functionality.
  constraints:
  - Use Python 3.12+ for all development tasks.
  - Follow established coding standards, including the use of dataclasses and Pydantic
    models for data structures, async/await for AI API calls, and pathlib.Path for
    file operations.
  - Avoid introducing new dependencies unless absolutely necessary and justified.
implementation:
- task: Address E501 (line-too-long) errors
  details: Refactor lines exceeding 79 characters by breaking them into multiple lines
    using implicit line continuation within parentheses, brackets, or braces. Ensure
    that the refactoring maintains code readability and functionality.

- task: Fix BLE001 (blind-except) errors
  details: Replace bare except clauses with specific exception handling to avoid catching
    unintended exceptions and to improve error handling clarity.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/template_loader.py
  - agentic_spec/template_validator.py
  acceptance: All BLE001 errors are resolved, and exception handling is specific and

- task: Correct TRY400 (error-instead-of-exception) errors
  details: Replace the use of 'error' with 'exception' in try-except blocks to adhere
    to standard Python terminology and improve code clarity.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/template_loader.py
  - agentic_spec/template_validator.py
  acceptance: All TRY400 errors are resolved, and exception handling terminology is
    consistent.

  step_id: 930a1e10:3
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Address G004 (logging-f-string) errors
  details: Replace f-strings in logging statements with lazy %-style formatting to
    defer string interpolation until the log message is actually needed, improving
    performance.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/template_loader.py
  - agentic_spec/template_validator.py
  acceptance: All G004 errors are resolved, and logging statements use lazy formatting.

- task: Resolve B904 (raise-without-from-inside-except) errors
  details: Use 'raise from' to explicitly chain exceptions, providing better traceback
    information and adhering to best practices.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/template_loader.py
  - agentic_spec/template_validator.py
  acceptance: All B904 errors are resolved, and exception chaining is explicit and

  step_id: 930a1e10:7
  sub_spec_id: null

    that should only run if no exceptions occur, improving code readability and logic.

- task: Implement automated linting checks in the development workflow
  details: Integrate pylint and black into the development workflow to automatically
    check for linting errors and enforce code formatting standards. This can be achieved
    by adding pre-commit hooks or integrating these tools into the CI/CD pipeline.

  - .github/workflows/lint.yml
  acceptance: Automated linting and formatting checks are in place, preventing future
    linting issues.

review_notes:
- "Check for any lines where implicit line continuation could reduce readability\u2014\
  prefer explicit parentheses and avoid breaking up logical expressions or function\
  \ signatures in confusing ways."
- When replacing mutable default arguments, ensure that all function signatures remain
  backward compatible and that any changes are reflected in related tests or documentation.
- Switching to pathlib.Path.open() may require updating any code that expects a plain
  file path or string; audit for places where open() is used indirectly (e.g., via
  libraries or config loaders).
- Automated linting via pre-commit and CI is a quick win, but ensure that the pre-commit
  config matches the exact versions of pylint and black specified in the dependencies
  to avoid version drift.
