    (Pydantic BaseModel or dataclass).'

context:
  project: agentic-spec
  domain: Python CLI tool for AI-powered specification generation
  dependencies:
  - name: pydantic
    version: null
  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - All data models in agentic_spec/models.py must inherit from Pydantic BaseModel.
  - Remove all usage of Python dataclasses from models.py.
  - Ensure all model fields are explicitly typed and leverage Pydantic's validation
    features.
  - Eliminate redundant or conflicting code related to previous data modeling approaches.
  - Maintain compatibility with existing serialization and validation logic.
  non_functional:
  - Refactored code must pass linting (e.g., flake8, black) with no new errors.
  - All models must pass static type checking (e.g., mypy) with no errors.
  - Refactoring should not degrade runtime performance or introduce breaking changes
    to public model interfaces.
  - Code should be clear, maintainable, and follow project style conventions.
  constraints:
  - Only Pydantic BaseModel is permitted for data modeling in models.py.
  - No dataclass usage is allowed in models.py after refactor.
  - No changes to files outside agentic_spec/models.py unless strictly required for
    compatibility.
implementation:
- task: Audit all classes in agentic_spec/models.py for data modeling approach
  details: Review each class definition in models.py. Identify which classes use dataclass,
    which use Pydantic BaseModel, and any that use neither. Document findings for
    reference.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  acceptance: A list of all model classes with their current base (dataclass, BaseModel,
    or other) is produced and reviewed.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: 1a5e9df3:0
  sub_spec_id: a6395497

  approvals: null
- task: Refactor dataclass-based models to inherit from Pydantic BaseModel
  details: For each model currently using @dataclass, remove the decorator and refactor
    the class to inherit from Pydantic BaseModel. Update field definitions to use
    Pydantic's Field where appropriate. Ensure all fields are explicitly typed and
    validated.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  acceptance: All former dataclass models now inherit from BaseModel, use explicit
    typing, and leverage Pydantic validation. No @dataclass decorators remain.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 1a5e9df3:1
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: may require changes to multiple models and careful
    field migration'
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Standardize all model fields for Pydantic compatibility
  details: Ensure every model field is explicitly typed and, where necessary, uses
    Pydantic's Field for default values, validation, or metadata. Remove any field
    definitions incompatible with Pydantic.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  acceptance: All fields in all models are compatible with Pydantic BaseModel and
    pass type checking.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: 1a5e9df3:2
  sub_spec_id: null
  decomposition_hint: 'composite: spans all model classes and may require field-by-field
    review'
  progress: null
  approvals: null
- task: Remove redundant or conflicting code related to previous data modeling approaches
  details: Identify and eliminate any code (e.g., utility functions, imports, mixins)
    that was only relevant to dataclass-based models or other legacy approaches. Ensure
    no dead code remains.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  acceptance: No code related to dataclasses or other legacy modeling approaches remains.
    Only Pydantic BaseModel is used.

- task: Update and run linting and static type checking
  details: Run the project's linting (e.g., flake8, black) and static type checking
    (e.g., mypy) tools on models.py. Fix any new errors or warnings introduced by
    the refactor.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  acceptance: Linting and type checking pass with no new errors or warnings.

  progress: null

- task: Test model serialization, validation, and integration with parent system
  details: Verify that all refactored models serialize and validate as expected. Run
    or update any existing tests that depend on models.py. If no tests exist, create
    minimal tests to cover model instantiation, validation, and serialization. Confirm
    that integration points with the parent system (e.g., CLI commands, spec generation
    logic) are not broken.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/models.py
  - tests/
  - agentic_spec/
  acceptance: All models pass serialization and validation tests. No integration points
    with the parent system are broken.
