  title: Test the AI provider abstraction
  inherits: []
  created: '2025-07-27T06:44:30.457930'
  version: '1.0'
  status: draft
  parent_spec_id: null
  child_spec_ids: null
context:
  project: agentic-spec
  domain: Python CLI tool for AI-powered specification generation
  dependencies:
  - name: pytest-cov
    version: 6.2.1
  - name: openai
    version: 1.97.1
  - name: pytest
    version: 7.4.0
  - name: asyncio
    version: builtin
  files_involved:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  - agentic_spec/exceptions.py
  - tests/test_core_ai_provider.py
requirements:
  functional:
  - Verify that the AI provider abstraction correctly delegates calls to the underlying
    AI API (e.g., OpenAI).
  - Ensure async/await patterns are respected in all AI provider methods.
  - 'Test error handling: confirm that exceptions from the AI provider are raised
    with informative messages.'
  - Validate configuration-driven behavior (e.g., model selection, API key usage)
    in the AI provider.
  - Test graceful fallback or error messaging when the AI service is unavailable.
  non_functional:
  - Tests must be isolated, deterministic, and not require actual API calls (use mocking).
  - Tests should be readable and maintainable for a solo developer.
  - All new tests must pass linting and formatting checks (ruff, pre-commit hooks).
  - Tests must be compatible with Windows and Unix line endings.
  constraints:
  - Do not introduce new dependencies unless absolutely necessary; prefer pytest and
    unittest.mock.
  - 'Follow the existing codebase structure: place tests in the tests/ directory.'
  - Use Python 3.12+ features and type hints.
  - Do not use mutable default arguments.
  - Maintain comprehensive error handling and informative exception messages.
  - Ensure all tests are compatible with async/await patterns.
implementation:
- task: Identify and analyze the AI provider abstraction in the codebase
  details: Review agentic_spec/core.py to locate the AI provider abstraction (class
    or function) responsible for interfacing with OpenAI or other AI APIs. Document
    its public interface, async methods, and configuration points.
  files:
  - agentic_spec/core.py
  acceptance: A clear mapping of the AI provider's interface and configuration options
    is documented as code comments or in a developer note.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: e59de6d2:0
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Design and implement unit tests for the AI provider abstraction
  details: 'Create a new test file tests/test_core_ai_provider.py. Use pytest and
    unittest.mock (AsyncMock) to mock all external API calls. Cover the following
    scenarios: successful response, API error/exception, invalid configuration, and
    service unavailability. Ensure all async methods are tested using pytest-asyncio
    or equivalent.'
  files:
  - tests/test_core_ai_provider.py
  acceptance: All relevant AI provider methods are tested for success, error, and
    edge cases. Tests run without real API calls and pass on both Windows and Unix.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: e59de6d2:1
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Test configuration-driven behavior and error handling
  details: Write tests that simulate different configuration scenarios (e.g., missing
    API key, invalid model name) and verify that the AI provider responds with informative
    exceptions as per agentic_spec/exceptions.py. Ensure error messages do not use
    string literals in raise statements.
  files:
  - tests/test_core_ai_provider.py
  - agentic_spec/exceptions.py
  acceptance: Tests confirm that configuration errors are handled gracefully and exceptions
    are raised with proper messages.
  estimated_effort: medium
  step_id: e59de6d2:2
  sub_spec_id: null
- task: Ensure code quality and compliance with project standards
  details: Run make lint, make test, and make format to ensure all new and modified
    files comply with ruff linting, formatting, and pre-commit hooks. Refactor tests
    as needed to resolve any warnings or errors.
  files:
  - tests/test_core_ai_provider.py
  acceptance: No new lint or formatting errors are introduced. All tests pass and
    are compatible with the project's quality gate.
  estimated_effort: low
  step_id: e59de6d2:3
  sub_spec_id: null
review_notes:
- "The spec assumes familiarity with async mocking; ensure you use unittest.mock.AsyncMock\
  \ for all async methods, and pytest-asyncio for async test functions\u2014double-check\
  \ that pytest-asyncio is available or add a dev dependency if missing."
- Clarify how configuration is injected into the AI provider abstraction (e.g., via
  constructor, environment variables, or config files); missing this detail could
  block test setup and error simulation.
- "Explicitly document or enforce that exception messages are not hardcoded string\
  \ literals in raise statements\u2014use constants or exception classes from agentic_spec/exceptions.py\
  \ to avoid accidental violations."
- Testing for Windows/Unix compatibility mainly concerns line endings in test files;
  add a .gitattributes entry or a pre-commit check if not already present, as this
  is easy to overlook and can cause CI failures.
