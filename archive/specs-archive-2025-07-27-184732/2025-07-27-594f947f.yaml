  project: agentic-spec
  domain: Python CLI tool for AI-powered specification generation
  dependencies: []
  files_involved:
  - webui/static/styles.css
requirements:
  functional:
  - Apply modern, clean visual styling to all UI elements including tables, navigation,
    and metadata sections.
  - Ensure all styled elements are readable and accessible, following best practices
    for color contrast and font sizing.
  - Implement responsive design to provide optimal viewing and interaction experience
    across mobile and desktop devices.
  non_functional:
  - Maintain accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) for color contrast and font sizes.
  - Ensure CSS changes do not negatively impact page load performance.
  - Support maintainability by using clear class naming and comments where appropriate.
  constraints:
  - All styling must be contained within webui/static/styles.css.
  - Do not introduce CSS frameworks or external dependencies.
  - Ensure compatibility with modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
implementation:
- task: Audit and document current styles in styles.css
  details: Review the existing styles.css file to identify current styling patterns,
    redundancies, and areas lacking modern or responsive design. Document findings
    and highlight sections needing improvement.
  files:
  - webui/static/styles.css
  acceptance: A brief written summary of current styles, with annotated sections in
    styles.css indicating areas for update.

    breakpoints. Provide a short markdown summary of styling conventions and responsive
    design approach.

review_notes:
- 'Missing Implementation Details: The spec does not specify which CSS selectors or
  class names are currently used for tables, navigation, and metadata, nor does it
  provide example HTML structure. This may slow down the audit and redesign steps.'
- 'Technical Gotchas: Without introducing a CSS framework, achieving a modern, responsive,
  and accessible design will require careful manual implementation of flexbox/grid,
  media queries, and focus states. Be prepared for more verbose CSS and edge-case
  browser quirks.'
- 'Integration Points: Since all styles must remain in a single CSS file, ensure that
  new rules do not unintentionally override or conflict with existing styles for unrelated
  components. Use BEM or similarly scoped class naming to avoid collisions.'
- 'Quick Wins: Use CSS custom properties (variables) for colors, spacing, and font
  sizes to simplify future updates and maintain consistency, as this is supported
  in all target browsers.'
